<h1>Quarantine &amp; Isolation Protocols Update: January 2, 2022</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Louisiana Department of Health announced enhanced public health recommendations based on the current surge in positive COVID-19 cases. The Louisiana Department of Education updated their guidance based on these recommendations, <a href=""https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/ready-to-achieve/ready-to-achieve!-2021-2022-school-operational-guidelines.pdf?sfvrsn=737f6718_26"">which you can view online</a>. Jefferson Parish Schools has remained in contact with medical professionals throughout this latest surge.</p>
<p>Based on these recommendations, we are making the following changes to our isolation and quarantine protocols, effective January 3, 2022:</p>
<p><strong>If You Test Positive for COVID-19</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everyone, regardless of vaccination status:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stay home for five days. If you have no symptoms or your symptoms are resolved after five days, you can leave your house and return to school/work.</li>
<li>If you have a fever, continue to stay home until your fever resolves.</li>
<li>Continue to wear a mask around others for five additional days. If school cannot ensure masking for five additional days, then the case should quarantine for a full 10 days.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If You Were a Close Contact/Exposed to Someone with COVID-19</strong></p>
<p><strong>Students who have completed the primary series of an mRNA vaccine:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wear a mask around others for 10 days.</li>
<li>Test on day five.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Staff who have completed the primary series of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine within the last 6 months, OR have completed the primary series of J&amp;J vaccine within the last 2 months, OR have been boosted:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wear a mask around others for 10 days.</li>
<li>Test on day five.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Students who are unvaccinated:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stay home for five days. After that continue to wear a mask around others for five additional days. If school cannot ensure masking for five additional days, then contact should quarantine for a full 10 days.</li>
<li>Test on day five.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Staff who are unvaccinated, OR have completed the primary series of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine over 6 months ago and are not boosted, OR completed the primary series of J&amp;J over 2 months ago and are not boosted:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stay home for five days. After that continue to wear a mask around others for five additional days. If school cannot ensure masking for five additional days, then contact should quarantine for a full 10 days.</li>
<li>Test on day five.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will continue to follow our remaining <em>Start Strong Jefferson</em> protocols when employees return January 3 and students return January 4. This includes encouraging vaccines and strongly recommending face masks while inside the school facility or in close proximity to others while outdoors.</p>
<p>This latest surge is a reminder that we must remain vigilant in our efforts to push back the virus and maintain safe, in-person learning. Vaccines remain the best public health measure to protect people from COVID-19, slow transmission, and reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging. As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, we will continue to analyze the latest data and consult with local and state officials to provide safe, in-person instruction.</p>

",,1,"<a></a>






<h1>Keeping Students &amp; Employees Safe</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The safety of our students and employees is our top responsibility. In light of the Governor’s Roadmap to Restarting Louisiana, the Louisiana Department of Education issued <em><a href=""https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/ready-to-achieve/ready-to-achieve!-2021-2022-school-operational-guidelines.pdf?sfvrsn=737f6718_12"">Ready to Achieve! 2021-22 School Operational Guidelines</a></em> pertaining to opening public and nonpublic school facilities to serve students in the 2021-22 school year. Should the public health situation worsen, restrictions may gradually tighten, allowing for less flexibility and fewer opportunities for in-person teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The <em>Start Strong Jefferson</em> plan follows guidelines based on Louisiana’s <em>Ready to Achieve!</em>. In addition to meeting the guidelines recommended by the state, we may take extra precautions to increase the safety of our students, employees, and families. Please note this plan may evolve throughout the school year in response to the latest medical recommendations. We will continue to work side-by-side with local, state, and federal medical experts to ensure our plan meets the changing nature of the pandemic.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<h3><strong>UPDATED 8/25/21</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How did you develop this <em>Start Strong Jefferson</em> plan?</strong></p>
<p>As educators, we are not experts on the virus. That’s why we’ve continued to work side-by-side with local and state medical experts since before the first case of COVID-19 in Jefferson Parish. We developed our mitigation measures using guidance from the Louisiana Department of Education, Louisiana Department of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local healthcare partners like Ochsner and Children’s Hospital New Orleans.</p>
<h3><strong>Will this plan change throughout the year?</strong></h3>
<p>Our guidelines are based on the best information available today. We will continue to work with medical experts to ensure our mitigation measures prioritize the safety of students and employees and are appropriate for the current health situation. As the virus and medical recommendations evolve, we will adjust our plans accordingly so we can continue to safely educate children through what we all hope is one of the final chapters of this terrible pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>Will there be cases of COVID-19 among students and employees?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. As long as the virus is present in our community, we should expect cases among students, employees, and families. This was the case last school year and will be the case until we can defeat this virus. Just like last school year when we were able to safely provide in-person instruction, we’ve worked with medical professionals to develop a process to follow when we learn of positive cases among students and employees.</p>
<h3><strong>Can schools still offer before and after care?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Employees and students must wear face masks and adhere to physical distancing protocols. Younger students who are unable to maintain physical distance should maintain static groups.</p>
<h3><strong>Are assemblies and field trips allowed?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Assemblies are limited to maximum group sizes and with appropriate physical distancing in place. For younger students unable to maintain physical distance, maintain static groups. Attendees must wear a face mask regardless of vaccination status. Students and staff should wash hands before and after events. Field trips can occur if strictly following masking, cohorting, and transportation requirements. Outdoor field trip opportunities should be prioritized, if possible.</p>
<h3><strong>How will high school and middle school athletics be impacted?</strong></h3>
<p>Athletic activities are allowed to resume with the recommendations put forth in the Louisiana High School Athletic Association’s Guidance for Opening Up High School Athletics and Activities. Outdoor and indoor spectator capacity for LHSAA-sanctioned athletics shall be set in accordance with the Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s guidelines developed in conjunction with the Office of the Governor and LDH at <a href=""http://opensafely.la.gov"">opensafely.la.gov</a>. We are following the same LHSAA guidelines for our middle school athletics. The only change is the order of the sports. Soccer will be held in the first nine weeks, basketball in the second nine weeks, football and volleyball third nine weeks, and baseball and softball in the fourth nine weeks. </p>
<h3><strong>Do students and employees have to wear face masks?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. <a href=""https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3301"">Governor John Bel Edwards temporarily reinstated Louisiana’s statewide mask mandate</a> as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations threatened hospitals’ ability to serve communities. Louisiana’s temporary indoor statewide mask mandate will stay in place until at least September 1, but may be extended if necessary. This applies to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Do face masks have to be worn on school buses?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. All drivers and passengers on the school bus must wear a face mask at all times per Presidential Executive Order No. 13998 for Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel.</p>
<h3><strong>Do face masks have to be worn outdoors on school campuses?</strong></h3>
<p>All fully vaccinated and unvaccinated adults and students do not need to wear a face mask if they adhere to physical distancing requirements while outdoors. It is recommended that people who are not fully vaccinated wear a face mask in crowded outdoor settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other individuals who are not fully vaccinated.</p>
<h3><strong>How will hand washing be conducted this school year?</strong></h3>
<p>Students and staff should wash or sanitize hands upon arrival at school, before and after eating, before and after using outdoor play equipment, and before exiting the school facility. Students should wash their hands or use hand sanitizer after changing any classroom. Teachers in the classroom should wash their hands or use hand sanitizer every time a new group of students enters. Hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol may be used in place of handwashing in some instances.</p>
<h3><strong>What daily cleaning efforts are taking place at my school?</strong></h3>
<p>High-touch surfaces should be cleaned with a commercially available cleaning solution, including EPA-approved disinfectants at least twice per day. This includes light switches, doors, benches, bannisters, and bathroom fixtures, surfaces and objects in libraries, labs, and other settings where “hands-on” materials and equipment are used. Student desks should be cleaned before and after each student’s use.</p>
<h3><strong>Are schools being supplied with cleaning supplies?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. School employees will be provided an adequate amount of hygienic supplies according to the role and the number and age of students or adults served by that employee.The district is providing cleaning and sanitation supplies to all schools to ensure consistency of sanitization across the district.</p>
<h3><strong>Will social distancing be practiced by students and employees?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Adults should maintain six feet of physical distance from other adults and students. Students should maintain a physical distance of at least three feet from other students and six feet from adults in a classroom or indoor setting to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<h3><strong>Are group sizes being limited?</strong></h3>
<p>The maximum group size that may convene indoors in a single room should be determined by physical distancing requirements.</p>
<h3><strong>Will students with disabilities continue to receive specialized services?</strong></h3>
<p>Students with disabilities should continue to receive special education and related services in the least restrictive environment.</p>
<h3><strong>Are COVID-19 vaccines mandated for students or employees?</strong></h3>
<p>No. Vaccines are effective, safe, free, and widely available. JP Schools is working side-by-side with medical professionals to provide vaccine resources and opportunities to our employees and families.</p>
<h3><strong>Why are children under age 12 attending school in-person when a vaccine is not yet available for those students?</strong></h3>
<p>This time last year, there was no vaccine. Following our layered mitigation efforts, we were able to safely educate children in-person. Medical experts testified to the state board of education that when following mitigation efforts, Louisiana schools were one of the safest environments in the state for children. We also know that in-person instruction is best for our children academically and social-emotionally. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Department of Education all recommended school systems place a high priority on in-person instruction. The Louisiana Department of Education also released LEAP data showing that virtual students lagged behind their peers learning in person last school year.</p>
<h3><strong>Will vaccines be offered at my school?</strong></h3>
<p>Eligible students and staff may have opportunities, throughout the school year, to receive the COVID-19 vaccination at a JPS School Based Health Center (SBHC) or school site. We’re continuing to partner with local organizations to offer free vaccines to students and adults. We have advocated for vaccine access for our employees, students, and families since vaccines became available. Vaccinations remain an essential piece in keeping our schools and community safe.</p>
<h3><strong>Where can I find more information or schedule a vaccine appointment?</strong></h3>
<p>Please visit <a href=""http://ldh.la.gov/covidvaccine"">ldh.la.gov/covidvaccine</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>What should I do if I feel sick?</strong></h3>
<p>Students and employees who are sick should stay home (regardless of the illness).</p>
<h3><strong>What happens if a student or employee has symptoms or is exposed to a COVID-19 positive individual?</strong></h3>
<p>Staff and families should notify school officials (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact) if they (staff) or their child (families) become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. Each school has established an area used to isolate staff and students with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, persistent cough, or shortness of breath). Students in the isolation area must be monitored at all times. The isolation area should be cleaned after it is occupied by a sick student or adult. Parents will be responsible for picking up their child from school if it is determined that the student has any signs of illness.</p>
<h3><strong>What happens when there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 from a student or employee at a school?</strong></h3>
<p>Schools have planned for and expect that some students/staff will contract COVID-19 during the school year given the levels of COVID-19 in our communities. Students and staff who have COVID-19 should stay home and remain isolated until they have recovered and have been determined to no longer be infectious according to CDC’s end of isolation criteria. Students, families, and employees should notify the school or their immediate supervisor if they test positive for COVID-19.</p>
<h3><strong>Will COVID-19 cases be shared publicly?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Schools will communicate with employees and parents of students who were in close contact with the affected COVID-19 individual. All COVID-19 cases will be reported to the Louisiana Department of Health in accordance with the School Reporting and Data Sharing Order.</p>
<h3><strong>When does it become necessary to close classes or schools?</strong></h3>
<p>This will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with medical experts. Closures of individual classes and/or schools may be necessary. Factors considered will be the level of community transmission, number of students/faculty affected, and risk of spread at the school.</p>
<h3><strong>How long does someone have to quarantine if they are identified as a close contact?</strong></h3>
<p>Close contacts who are fully vaccinated (i.e., ≥2 weeks following receipt of the second dose in a 2-dose series, or ≥2 weeks following receipt of one dose in a single-dose vaccine) at the time of exposure and remain asymptomatic do not need to be quarantined.</p>
<p>Close contacts of a COVID-19 positive individual must stay home for 10-14 days following exposure. If no symptoms develop during quarantine and no testing is done, the individual may quarantine for 10-14 days from last contact with a COVID-19 case. If quarantine is shortened, daily symptom monitoring and strict adherence to prevention measures including physical distancing, hand washing, and wearing face masks should continue until 14 days from last contact with a COVID-19 case. Close contacts who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 90 days and remain asymptomatic do not need to quarantine.</p>
<h3><strong>What are schools doing to educate children who are quarantined?</strong></h3>
<p>Should students need to be quarantined, they will bring devices home, access assignments in Google Classroom and conduct asynchronous learning for days out of school. Teachers will check assignments, provide feedback for assignments through Google Classroom and monitor student work.</p>
<h3><strong>Is technology available for students who have to continue their education at home?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. The district has 1:1 device capacity for K-12 graders and will provide students with district computers in order to support instructional technology for teaching and learning. We continue to partner with Cox Communications so qualified families can easily access discounted, low-cost home internet. More information is available at <a href=""http://jpschools.org/internetoffer"">jpschools.org/internetoffer</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Are visitors allowed in school buildings?</strong></h3>
<p>Any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations will be allowed but limited. Nonessential visitors or non-district employees must wear face masks and maintain a physical distance of six feet from each other, are subject to a temperature screening, and must sanitize their hands upon arrival.</p>
<h3><strong>What is an essential visitor?</strong></h3>
<p>Essential visitors are individuals who must enter schools in order to conduct visits in accordance with Louisiana law or policy. Essential visitors include, but are not limited to,individuals, who conduct CLASS observations, observe teacher candidates as part of the teacher preparation quality rating system, provide essential supports and services including, but not limited to, early intervention services, special education services, and mental health consultation.</p>
<h3><strong>Why are there delays or disruptions to bus transportation?</strong></h3>
<p>We know some of our families have faced delays or disruptions to bus transportation since school started. We know this is an inconvenience for our families. Across the state and nation, districts are facing a shortage of bus drivers. Unfortunately the impact of COVID-19 has left a shortage of bus drivers with our transportation vendor. We are working with our vendor to fill vacant bus driver positions as soon as possible while also dealing with the additional impact due to COVID-19 absences and quarantines. One temporary solution is adding additional school bus routes to buses which already have established routes. Due to increased demand on previously established bus routes, this may cause delays as the routes were not created to run with the added school routes. However, it will allow more of our students to be transported to school on a daily basis.  If students are tardy because of a bus delay, the tardy will be excused. If the bus doesn’t run and families are unable to transport their child, please contact the school.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Testing Information for Families and Employees</strong></p>
<p>Access to testing is one way Jefferson Parish Schools is helping to reduce the risk of COVID-19 on campus. Families are encouraged to get tested through one of the many community testing sites. At many of these sites, testing is free for people without insurance. As an added layer of safety, Jefferson Parish employees have access to free rapid testing through Ochsner Urgent Care. For more information on testing locations for families and employees, see below.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Ochsner Rapid Testing Program for Employees</strong></p>
<p>As a part of the Ochsner Safe Return to Schools Program, we teamed up with Ochsner to quickly determine if an employee has COVID-19 and take the appropriate precautions to mitigate the spread and disruptions to learning.  This rapid testing will allow another layer of safety for employees and students to ensure that we mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and disruptions to learning. At this time, students or family members are not included in the Jefferson Parish Schools Ochsner Rapid Testing Program.</p>
<p><strong>As a part of the Ochsner Safe Return to Schools Program, symptomatic Jefferson Parish Schools employees or employees that have a known exposure to a lab-confirmed COVID positive case have priority access to testing at one of these locations. </strong><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EA9Ungudk-H8HaZrdmcnkByHOEJiUAoW/view?usp=sharing"">Click here to view a list of the Ochsner Health Urgent Cares and their location details.</a></p>
<p><strong>It is recommended that the symptomatic employee be tested right away. Exposed employees should wait until day five or later after initial exposure to be tested.</strong></p>
<p>Below are the steps for symptomatic employees and schools to access the program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Symptomatic employees call their school’s office to speak to the school nurse.</li>
<li>The school nurse gives symptomatic employees a number to call to schedule a visit to an Ochsner Health Urgent Care.</li>
<li>Symptomatic employees call the designated Ochsner number.</li>
<li>Ochsner staff gathers information needed and registers symptomatic employees.</li>
<li>Symptomatic employees arrive at the Ochsner Health Urgent Care they’ve been instructed to go to and sign in. </li>
<li>Once the symptomatic employees are able to be seen, they receive a Rapid Test.</li>
<li>Symptomatic employees either 1) wait at the Urgent Care for results or 2) leave to go home and check results on MyOchsner. The results should be available by the end of day, if not before.</li>
<li>Employees’ insurance will be billed for the test at no cost to the employee. If employees don’t have insurance, there will be no cost to the employee.</li>
<li>While they are at the Urgent Care, symptomatic employees can decide on their own to see a provider, but it is not required. If employees choose to see a provider, normal provider fees are incurred based on the employees’ insurance.</li>

<h2><strong>Test to Stay Program</strong></h2>
<p>Beginning Monday, March 7, 2022, Jefferson Parish Schools will offer Test to Stay (TTS) for employees and students as a strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and support the continuation of in-person learning.</p>
<p>We have continuously prioritized maintaining a safe teaching and learning environment, and this Test to Stay (TTS) is another mitigation tool in a layered COVID-19 prevention strategy. It adds an extra layer of safety for our school community and allows schools to maximize instructional time by decreasing disruptions to teaching and learning. This new strategy also aligns to guidance from the Louisiana Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control. </p>
<p>TTS allows unvaccinated, asymptomatic individuals who are identified as a close contact of a person with COVID-19 to continue to attend work or school. Those individuals can also participate in extracurricular activities in a modified quarantine while committing to a testing protocol. Individuals who develop symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive for COVID-19 will not be eligible for TTS and will be required to follow current guidelines for isolation.  Individuals who do not wish to participate in TTS will be required to follow current quarantine guidelines if not fully vaccinated and exposed to someone with COVID-19.</p>

<p> JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Our nearly 50,000 students are always at the heart of everything we do. The 2020-21 school year presented many challenges, but I am proud that we continued to push for the best outcomes for our students. The students we educate today are tomorrow’s teachers, scientists and healthcare professionals who will take care of us in the future. When our students are successful and prepared for a career or college, the entire community benefits. Our economy will thrive, our healthcare system will improve, and Jefferson Parish Schools will become a proof point for what is possible in a large urban district. We are excited to continuously implement the priorities set forth in our strategic plan, “<a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/6//2024/2024-The-Future-Our-Kids-Deserve.pdf"">2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve.</a>” Continuing this work remains critical to the future of Jefferson Parish, and the continued support of our families and the community is paramount to our success.</p>
<p>In many ways, our efforts to overcome the challenges of the pandemic <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/136/Building the Future Our Kids Deserve Booklet August 2021.pdf"">hastened progress towards achieving our strategic goals</a>. We improved our infrastructure to support clean, healthy and modern schools and doubled down on our investments in technology to provide access and equity for all students. Whether learning in the classroom or at home, all students in kindergarten through 12th grade have access to a computer and the internet. By closing the digital divide, we are providing equity and opportunity, leveling the playing field for all students.</p>
<p>Additionally, through federal COVID-19 relief funds, we have been able to launch several new initiatives including innovative summer programs, an early literacy strategic plan, increased opportunities to earn Industry Based Credentials and the soon to open Jefferson Virtual High School. These student-centered steps brought us closer to our long-term goals in addition to overcoming the pandemic’s impact on teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The quantity and quality of initiatives we were able to roll out shows the strength of our educators, support staff, school board and community. While I never imagined I would be starting a tenure as Superintendent during a global pandemic, I also never imagined how much we would accomplish given the challenges. I am proud of the work we’ve done and the added support we’ve provided to our employees and families. I am optimistic, knowing our students will graduate prepared to make the world a better place. Together, we will be the champions our students deserve.</p>
<p>Dr. James Gray</p>

<p> JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Our nearly 50,000 students are always at the heart of everything we do. The 2020-21 school year presented many challenges, but I am proud that we continued to push for the best outcomes for our students. The students we educate today are tomorrow’s teachers, scientists and healthcare professionals who will take care of us in the future. When our students are successful and prepared for a career or college, the entire community benefits. Our economy will thrive, our healthcare system will improve, and Jefferson Parish Schools will become a proof point for what is possible in a large urban district. We are excited to continuously implement the priorities set forth in our strategic plan, “<a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/6//2024/2024-The-Future-Our-Kids-Deserve.pdf"">2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve.</a>” Continuing this work remains critical to the future of Jefferson Parish, and the continued support of our families and the community is paramount to our success.</p>
<p>In many ways, our efforts to overcome the challenges of the pandemic <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/136/Building the Future Our Kids Deserve Booklet August 2021.pdf"">hastened progress towards achieving our strategic goals</a>. We improved our infrastructure to support clean, healthy and modern schools and doubled down on our investments in technology to provide access and equity for all students. Whether learning in the classroom or at home, all students in kindergarten through 12th grade have access to a computer and the internet. By closing the digital divide, we are providing equity and opportunity, leveling the playing field for all students.</p>
<p>Additionally, through federal COVID-19 relief funds, we have been able to launch several new initiatives including innovative summer programs, an early literacy strategic plan, increased opportunities to earn Industry Based Credentials and the soon to open Jefferson Virtual High School. These student-centered steps brought us closer to our long-term goals in addition to overcoming the pandemic’s impact on teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The quantity and quality of initiatives we were able to roll out shows the strength of our educators, support staff, school board and community. While I never imagined I would be starting a tenure as Superintendent during a global pandemic, I also never imagined how much we would accomplish given the challenges. I am proud of the work we’ve done and the added support we’ve provided to our employees and families. I am optimistic, knowing our students will graduate prepared to make the world a better place. Together, we will be the champions our students deserve.</p>
<p>Dr. James Gray</p>

<h1>School Reopening</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Jefferson Parish Schools is utilizing a tiered reopening due to the varying nature of damage at schools in the district. The first day for students at tier 1 schools is planned for September 20, tier 2 schools September 24, and tier 3 schools October 1. The plan is listed as tentative because it relies on the timeline of contractors for releasing school buildings back to the district. Contractors will release schools to the district as they meet safety, environmental, and operational standards. </p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Grand Isle School, Leo Kerner Elementary, and Fisher Middle-High will not be part of the general reopening tiers due to the significant impact of the storm in Grand Isle and Lafitte. We will directly communicate reopening plans with those employees and families prior to any public announcement. JP Schools charter schools will also not be a part of the reopening tiers. Those schools will directly communicate individual reopening plans with their employees and families.</p>

<h2><strong>Listen and Learn Town Halls</strong></h2>
<p>We value input from our stakeholders as their feedback and insight helps us make better decisions as we move forward together. The purpose of the town hall meetings is to provide an opportunity for families, employees and community members to have open-ended conversations with Superintendent Dr. James Gray. During these six town halls, he will answer questions, hear concerns, and understand how our stakeholders view Jefferson Parish Schools. </p>
<p>These meetings are structured as informal open forums. There are no set agendas for any meeting, and any participant may ask a question or offer a suggestion. All town hall meetings are open to the public. </p>
<p>In partnership with the Jefferson Federation of Teachers, three of the town halls will focus on issues important to employees. The other three will focus on families and the community. </p>
<p>The meetings will take place on alternating sides of the river, and interpreters will be available. Each meeting will run from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p> Given limited capacity, attendees should register in advance using the links below. </p>

<h1>Board Meeting Guide</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Jefferson Parish school board consists of nine members elected from districts by the citizens of Jefferson Parish. The superintendent is appointed by the school board to manage the administrative team of Jefferson Parish Schools. The School Board Meeting Guide has been prepared to assist you in understanding how the Jefferson Parish school board meetings are conducted and how you may participate.</p>
<p>The school board schedules meetings once a month, with special meetings throughout the year as needed. School board members also serve on smaller committees that focus on specific issues, such as<br/>legislation, academic affairs, finance, insurance, facilities, and transportation, in addition to the executive committee, which focuses on specific administrative matters. These committees meet periodically throughout the year. Regular meetings of the school board are held at the Administration Building (501 Manhattan Boulevard in Harvey) on the West Bank or Bonnabel Magnet Academy High School (2801 Bruin Drive in Kenner) on the East Bank beginning at 6 p.m. Times and locations are subject to change.</p>
<p>The purpose of the school board meetings is to act upon recommendations from the superintendent, authorize the spending of funds, adopt policies, and approve the annual budget. Specific school-related<br/>issues are handled through administrative channels, beginning with school staff and leadership.</p>
<p>All regular, special, or emergency school board meetings are open to the public, and parents and community members are encouraged to attend. The board may occasionally recess into executive session during a board meeting to discuss items pertaining to litigation, personnel issues or other items approved by state statute. No official action can be taken during executive session.</p>
<h3><strong>AGENDAS AND MINUTES</strong></h3>
<p>Agendas are available at the meeting, on the school board page of the district website or on Board Docs. The agenda is divided into several sections, including:</p>
<h4><strong>CONSENT AGENDA</strong></h4>
<p>All recommendations from the superintendent, including administrative, business, and construction items, must be put on the consent agenda to be voted on by the school board. Recommendations<br/>from board committees will also be placed on the consent agenda for consideration. Board members may pull individual items from the consent agenda for discussion during the board meeting, then vote on the item individually. All items not pulled for discussion from the consent agenda will be voted on collectively.</p>
<h4><strong>NEW BUSINESS</strong></h4>
<p>This section will include first readings and other new business, which are items introduced by individual board members. All items of business that board members want to be considered and voted upon will be presented as a first reading at a board meeting. No debate, discussion, or vote is allowed on a first reading. The first reading will then be placed on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled board meeting as a second reading, which may be discussed and put to a vote. Board minutes of public meetings are also available on the website after they have been adopted by the school board.</p>
<h4><strong>FIRST READING</strong></h4>
<p>Items of business first introduced by an individual board member during a board meeting. First readings cannot be discussed or voted upon and will be presented as second readings at the next meeting.</p>
<h4><strong>SECOND READING</strong></h4>
<p>A business item previously introduced as a first reading by an individual board member. The second reading may be discussed and voted upon at the board meeting at which it appears on the agenda.</p>
<h3><strong>PUBLIC COMMENT</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone is welcome to speak at school board meetings. Public comment generally appears in four sections of a board meeting. The public may make comments prior to second readings, prior to the consent agenda, and prior to items pulled from consent agenda. Other general comments may be made at the end of the meeting, prior to the announcements. Members of the public who wish to address the Board are required to fill out a comment card and submit it to the board secretary before the meeting begins. Comment cards can be found in the entryway of the board room.</p>
<p>Persons addressing the board are asked to be courteous and respectful. Individuals are asked to approach the board and state their name and address for the record. Public comments are limited to three (3) minutes per person.</p>
<h3><strong>CONTACTING THE BOARD</strong></h3>
<p>The public may contact the board secretary at 504-349-7803. Contact information for individual board members can be found on the board member page of the district website</p>

<p><strong>First Reading authored by Mr. Moïse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On October 3, 2018 the Jefferson Parish School Board voted unanimously to accept the plan<br/>promulgated by the Hill Group as the FACILITIES MASTER PLAN OF ACTION. Our approved plan<br/>includes detailed recommendations for transforming our educational facilities into a modern,<br/>relevant and flexible system capable of addressing the needs of our children for decades to come.<br/>The estimate attached to these recommendations was over $700,000,000.<br/>The Hill Group plan detailed a shocking underutilization of our facilities. In fact, it found sixteen (16)<br/>of our schools had utilization rates under 70 percent. With underutilization of capital, operational<br/>costs are higher than necessary. Before seeking additional tax revenues to fund and execute the<br/>modernization and new construction recommendations included in the plan, it is prudent that we<br/>drive out any inefficiencies that currently exist in our portfolio of schools.<br/>Accordingly, I move the Administration provide this Board with the following information and<br/>recommendations on the timeline established:</li>
<li>By the December Meeting the Board:
<ul>
<li>Information Requested:
<ul>
<li>The student capacity of each school</li>
<li>The current student membership of each school</li>
<li>Occupancy as a percentage of capacity for each school</li>
<li>A listing of land owned by the Board that does not occupy a school</li>
<li>A listing of elementary and k-8 school sites without playgrounds for recess</li>
<li>A recommendation on whether the District should expand opportunities for Career and<br/>Technical Education (CTE) at current sites or provide a stand-alone CTE high school as called<br/>for in the Facilities Master Plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By the March 2020 Meeting of the Board
<ul>
<li>A “2020 Infrastructure and Efficiency Plan”, informed by the following considerations:
<ul>
<li>School consolidations to optimize occupancy and reduce operational costs</li>
<li>Expansion of the PK-8 model</li>
<li>Increase Early Childhood Education (ECE) seats where demand exceeds space</li>
<li>Expanded opportunities for the aforementioned Career and Technical Education (CTE)<br/>offerings</li>
<li>Accommodates school choice for parents and encourages healthy competition for students</li>
<li>Ensures greater efficiency in transportation costs, eliminating light loads and dead mileage<br/>as much as possible</li>
<li>Addresses the increasing demand for seats in our Academies</li>
<li>Any pervasive, urgent issues at any of our campuses</li>

<h1>Raise the Bar</h1>
<p>Build a school that makes college and career success a reality for every student. We trust our leaders to make the best decisions for their schools, and we give you the flexibility to do just that.</p>
<h1>Tools and Support</h1>
<p>The unique network model in Jefferson Parish matches your school with an experienced network executive director who will coach and support you throughout the year, as well as  a cohort of principals with whom you can explore solutions. In addition, each network has a dedicated instructional staff who can help mentor your teachers and design improved instructional tools. The Compass evaluation system will help you have conversations to develop your own teachers, as well as providing regular feedback for you that can enable you to improve.</p>
<h1>Flexibility</h1>
<p>At JP schools, we believe that decisions affecting students are best made at the school level — not at the central office. Over the past several years, the district has increased the decision-making power of principals so that excellent school leaders like you have hiring flexibility to choose a strong team, the ability to choose your own curriculum in response to challenging standards, and resource flexibility to make key financial decisions for your school. With these tools, you have what you need to build a school where every student attains their potential, every day.</p>
<h1>Apply</h1>
<p>There is no exceptional school without an exceptional leader. Join our team. Applications for principal positions will be considered in late spring and early summer. A competency-based principal selection process has been developed specifically for Jefferson Parish Public School System.  The selection process has four rounds and each activity measures specific leadership skills that are aligned to the Compass Louisiana Leader Performance Evaluation Rubric.

<p>Resources to Support Math Instruction at Home</p>
<p>Jefferson Parish Schools is committed to supporting its families with math resources. We recognize math concepts look different than when many of our parents were in school. Math now balances procedural skills, application of skills in various contexts, and conceptual understanding of those skills. It is no longer just about the HOW, but also the WHY.</p>
<p>JPS has multiple resources to support your students in Mathematics, all highly-rated, Tier 1 instructional materials by the Louisiana Department of Education and EdReports. Below, you will find resources to support with Eureka Math, Zearn Math and Khan Academy. All students are learning Eureka Math as the primary curriculum, so that is a good place to start. Zearn Math and Khan Academy are supplemental. Explore these resources to find what is most helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>Eureka Math (Core Tier 1 Curriculum)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parent Tip Sheets (<a href=""https://greatminds.org/resources/products/group/eureka-parent-tip-sheets"">English</a>/<a href=""https://greatminds.org/resources/products/group/consejos-para-padres"">Spanish</a>) These tip sheets include suggested strategies and models, key vocabulary, connections to previous learning, and tips for how you can support your child’s learning at home.  They are arranged in the same sequence as the student homework, making it easy for parents to follow along with their child’s progress. Homework helpers are also available in student homework books.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Zearn Math (Supplemental Tier 1 Curriculum)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.zearn.org/"">Zearn Math</a> is a digitally based platform that aligns, and follows, the Eureka Math curriculum for grades K-5. It allows a new way for students to engage authentically with math and supports the rigor of a strong Math curriculum. Lessons follow closely to the design of the core curriculum and provide support as students progress through the lessons. Please reach out to your school should you need support. <strong>Students are able to access through Clever.</strong></li>
<li>A Zearn pilot is underway for grades 6-7 that is aligned to two Tier 1 curricula, Eureka Math and Illustrative Math. It does not follow either curriculum explicitly.</li>
<li>Zearn Math Parent/Caregiver Pack (<a href=""https://help.zearn.org/hc/en-us/articles/360044495614-Zearn-Math-Parent-Caregiver-Pack-English-"">English</a>/<a href=""https://help.zearn.org/hc/en-us/articles/360045025533-Zearn-Math-Parent-Caregiver-Pack-Spanish-"">Spanish</a>)</li>

<p><strong>Khan Academy (Supplemental Support)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/signup?continue=%2Flogin%3Fcontinue%3D%252Fparent"">Khan Academy </a>provides high-quality mathematics support. This resource is not a curriculum but allows you to assist your student in acquiring extra practice for key grade-level skills. You can navigate to various grade levels and courses.<br/>NOTE: You will need to create a free parent account to access. It is suggested that you monitor this resource to ensure your student is working on items that align to core content being learned in the classroom</li>

<p>The very best thing you can do to help your child become a better reader is to simply read with them! Reading aloud to children has been shown to improve reading, writing and communication skills, logical thinking, concentration, and general academic aptitude, as well as inspire a lifelong love of reading. Make it a goal to read with your child for 20 minutes a day, and talk about what you read together.</p>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools recently launched its Early Literacy Collaborative. Leaders across Jefferson Parish are learning more about the best practices in early literacy instruction in order to improve student outcomes in reading. We are taking a deep dive into the science of reading, as well as our district’s research-based, English Language Arts curriculum for Kindergarten through second grade, Amplify Core Knowledge Language Arts (CKLA). </p>

<p>At-Home Literacy Activities</p>
<p>Research tells us that ""involvement with reading activities at home has significant positive influences not only on reading achievement, language comprehension and expressive language skills (Gest, Freeman, Domitrovich &amp; Welsh, 2004), but also on pupils’ interest in reading, attitudes towards reading and attentiveness in the classroom (Rowe, 1991)."" Extending literacy into the home is paramount in the overall development of young children. Parents play a large role in exposing young children to quality literature to enrich and extend learning from the classroom.</p>
<p>In Jefferson Parish, we utilize the thematic learning of the Frog Street Press Pre-K curriculum to provide extension activities so that parents can play an active role in students' education. Our goal is to extend learning past the walls of our classrooms. There are many fun activities you can do at home to develop literacy skills. Through dynamic instruction and purposeful home/school connections, we are creating lifelong learners and readers. The below activities come recommended from our Pre-K department, and are suited for children from preschool through third grade.</p>

Begin with identifying the letters in the child’s name. When identifying the letters, you can also identify the sound associated with each letter. Once your student shows a familiarity with the letter names and sounds, you can begin to brainstorm and come up with other words that begin with the same sound.</p>



</li>
</ul>

















<ul>

<p><strong>“ABC by Me”</strong><strong><img alt=""drawing letters"" id="""" role=""presentation"" src=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/998/literacy icons 222222.png"" style="""" width=""250""/></strong>Provide paper and guidance for kids to create their very own alphabet book. This is a project you can do with your student over a few weeks, only making a page or 2 at a time. Once your child understands the task, s/he can begin to work on their own to create pages of the book for each letter. Provide your child with a variety of materials; stickers, magazines with pictures to cut out, crayons to create their own drawings, etc. When the book is complete, host a book party with the family to share his/her creation with everyone.

This is a great activity for meal times and while doing laundry. Allow your child to sort items and guide him/her to explain their reasoning for the categories (colors, sizes, textures, etc). Use this activity to build new vocabulary and allow your child to explore the world around him/her.</p>

Engage your child in reading by encouraging him/her to point to each word. Talk about the story as you read it. What do you think will happen next? What does this story remind you of? How do you think this character feels? Don’t be afraid to read the same book again! Repeated reading helps build reading fluency.

<p>LEAP 2025 </p>
<p>The Louisiana Educational Assessment Program (LEAP) 2025 is a statewide assessment program for students in grades 3 through high school to measure student knowledge and skills in key courses: English Language Arts (ELA), Mathematics, Science and Social Science. </p>
<p>A student’s results on the LEAP 2025 are evaluated along with a student’s report cards and benchmark assessments to measure academic performance and ensure the student is ready to move onto the next level of study. The aggregate results are also used in determining a school’s performance score. </p>
<p>Students with disabilities may be eligible to take <strong>LEAP Connect</strong>.</p>
<p>For more information on LEAP 2025 and LEAP Connect, visit the <a href=""https://www.louisianabelieves.com/resources/library/family-support-toolbox-library"">Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE)</a> website.</p>

<p>Eight Tips for LEAP 2025 Success</p>
<p>This April and May, all JP Schools students in grades three through 12 will be required to take LEAP 2025, the state’s standardized student assessment test. Results from LEAP 2025 are helpful to evaluate student knowledge and skills for their grade level, and they can be used along with report cards and other assessments to determine a student’s readiness to move on to the next level of study. For testing dates and how to access sample questions, visit the <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/Page/3230"">LEAP 2025 page</a>.</p>
<p>To help families prepare for LEAP 2025, we’ve put together eight tips for student success.</p>
<p><strong>1. Fuel and rest.</strong><br/>Be sure to get a good night’s rest and eat a healthy breakfast before the test.</p>
<p><strong>2. Breathe and relax.</strong><br/>Take a moment to focus on your breathing and try to relax. Stay positive and push negative thoughts from your mind. Repeat these steps if you find yourself getting frustrated or over-anxious during the test. Remember, just try your best.</p>
<p><strong>3. Look over the entire test first.</strong><br/>Review all the passages and amount of questions before starting. This will give you a general idea of how long it will take to complete the test. Don’t rush, but as you work through each section, pay attention to how much time you have left so you can pace yourself appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>4. Read each question carefully.</strong><br/>Think through each part of the question, and think about similar questions from class. Look for clues within the wording of the question itself. Sometimes, paraphrasing the question may help. Always reread difficult questions and <strong>highlight</strong> important information.</p>
<p><strong>5. Consider all the answers in multiple choice questions.</strong><br/>Be sure to read through all of the available answers before making your choice, even if you think you know the right answers. Use the <strong>cross-off</strong> feature to eliminate choices.</p>
<p><strong>6. Be thorough in constructed responses and essay questions.</strong><br/>Answer all parts of the prompt and be sure to include evidence as needed. Before moving on, proofread to make sure your responses make sense, and check spelling and grammar.</p>
<p><strong>7. Don’t get stuck on the tough ones.</strong><br/>Don’t spend too much time on these questions. <strong>Flag</strong> the question and go back to it later. There may be questions in another section of the test that could jog your memory or provide more clues.</p>
<p><strong>8. Use extra time wisely.</strong><br/>Use any leftover time to review all of your answers. Check for careless mistakes and review any questions you flagged or skipped. Reread questions to ensure you haven’t misunderstood or misread anything.</p>


<p><strong>Online Testing Tools</strong><br/>All grades will be taking LEAP 2025 on a computer, so it is good to familiarize yourself with these test taking tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>Line Guide</strong> to help as you are reading passages. It helps you stay focused and keep track of which line you are reading.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sticky Note</strong> to take notes on evidence you might use in evidence based responses.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Highlighter</strong> to highlight important information in the question.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Cross-Off</strong> to mark the answers you know are wrong.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Pointer</strong> to select an answer.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Magnifier</strong> to increase the size of text.</li>

<h1>JP Schools Student Fees</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>All schools will now begin using the same schedule of fees. This is a list of authorized school fees that includes each fee’s purpose, use, amount or authorized range, and how each will be collected. </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In addition, families who meet the guidelines for waivers may receive a 50% reduction in student fees. Fees covered by the amended policy are any monetary payment or supplies required as a condition of a student being enrolled in school or participating in any curricular or co-curricular activity. This does not include fees associated with before or after-care, class trips, items purchased through third-party vendors, and fees associated with extracurricular activities. </p>
<p>Some examples of waiver eligibility include active military, foster care, homelessness, or families who are on government assistance. </p>
<p>Parents or legal guardians may request and receive a waiver of payment of a fee due to economic hardship. Waivers are available on the district’s website (see below), with the school counselor/social worker, and at the district’s Compliance Office (501 Manhattan Blvd., Harvey, LA 70058). If a waiver is denied at the school level, the parent or legal guardian may appeal the decision to the district’s Compliance Office. </p>

<p><em>Jefferson Summer Bridge</em> provides targeted groups of students with accelerated learning and growth during the summer months in a fun learning environment. The full day program included a combination of math and ELA acceleration, enrichment opportunities to develop the whole child, and support for students’ social and emotional needs. More than 4,200 students in grades PreK-7 participated in the first year of programming. The teachers and leaders at our schools know their students best, so schools across our district were cohorted to create a community approach to planning and implementation. </p>
<p>""We are going to be working with our kids to understand IMPORTANT things like grit, perseverance and stamina. We want them to learn to work through problems."" - SUPERINTENDENT Dr. James Gray<br/><br/>High School summer programming was also available. <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=4&amp;ModuleInstanceID=173&amp;ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=52784&amp;PageID=1"">See here for more information</a>.</p>

<p>Jefferson Summer BridgeJune 8 - 30, 2021<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide students with the learning they need to be successful. Due to school closures in March 2020 and pandemic-related learning disruptions, students may have experienced learning losses. This year, our teachers, support staff, and administrators have stepped up to meet our students where they are and provide quality teaching and learning. However, it was important that we continued to provide accelerated learning opportunities to students this summer. </p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<h3><strong>Compulsory School Attendance/Compulsory Ages/Duty of Parent-Legal Guardian/Consent to Withdraw</strong></h3>
<p>In compliance with the Louisiana Revised Statute 17:221, the policy of Jefferson Parish Schools requires that every parent/legal guardian residing within Jefferson Parish, having control or charge of any child from that child’s seventh (7th) birthday until his/her eighteenth (18th) birthday, shall send such child to a public or private day school, or have him/her enrolled in an approved home study program, unless the child graduates from high school prior to his/her eighteenth (18) birthday. Any child below the age of seven (7) who legally enrolls in school shall also be subject to compulsory attendance provisions. Every parent/legal guardian responsible for sending a child to a public or private day school under provisions of this section shall also assure the attendance of such child in regularly assigned classes during regular school hours established by the School Board. </p>
<p>Marriage of minors under the age of eighteen (18) years results in their emancipation; hence there is no person in charge or control of them and no method or procedure by which their attendance in school can be compelled.</p>

<h3><strong>Types of Absences</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>Exempted and Excused</strong>: The student is allowed to make up missed work and the absence is not counted against attendance requirements. Examples are extended illness, court, death in immediate family, or religious holidays with proper verification. </p>
<h3><strong>B.</strong> <strong>Non-Exempted and Excused</strong>: Absences incurred due to personal illness documented by parental notes. The student is allowed to make up missed work and absences are considered when determining whether the student meets attendance requirements. </h3>
<h3><strong>C.</strong> <strong>Unexcused</strong>: The student is not allowed to miss work and the absence is counted against the attendance requirement. An example is skipping school </h3>
<h3><strong>D.</strong> <strong>Out of school suspensions</strong>: The student is allowed to make up missed work but the absence is counted against the attendance requirement. (not for truancy purposes) </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Absence Procedures</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Excuses for all absences must be presented in writing to the school principal or designee within five (5) days of the absence. </li>
<li>For any extenuating circumstances, the student’s parent or legal guardian must make a formal appeal to the Compliance Office requesting exception to the attendance regulation. Students who are verified as meeting extenuating circumstances, and therefore eligible to receive grades, shall not receive grades if they are unable to complete make-up work or pass the course. </li>
<li>Schools are to provide students and parents with attendance letters by the 3rd, 5th, and 8th day absent. Parents must contact the school principal or school counselor to discuss attendance matters upon receipt of attendance letters.  </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Elementary/Middle Schools:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>According to the policy of the state of Louisiana, students must attend elementary or middle school for a total of 60,120 minutes to<br/>be eligible for promotion. Based on the school calendar and a standard 375 minute instructional day, a student can miss no more than<br/>14 days of school to be eligible for promotion.</p>
<p><strong>High School Students:</strong></p>
<p>In order to receive grades for a semester/year, high school students must be in attendance for a minimum of 30,060 minutes in a semester or 60,120 minutes in a year for schools not operating on a semester system.</p>
<p>Based on a standard 360 minute instructional day, this means that students in a high school on a semester system can miss no more than 7 days in the 90-day first semester and 7 days in the 93-day second semester. Students in schools not on a semester system can miss no more than 14 days to be eligible for promotion Carnegie units based on minutes.</p>

<h4><strong>Attendance Requirements - Carnegie Credit</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to meeting overall attendance requirements, middle and high school students must also meet certain attendance requirements to receive Carnegie Credit for individual classes.</p>
<p>In order to earn one Carnegie Credit, students must be in attendance in a specific course for 7,515 minutes. The length of periods and courses varies by school, but as an illustration, if a school is on a 4X4 block schedule and has courses that are 90 minutes long, a student must attend at least 84 classes (7,515 divided by 90). If there were 89 course meetings, the student could miss a maximum of 7 course meetings (89-84) and still receive credit. For middle school students to earn Carnegie Credits, the same standards apply.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The charter schools department is a part of the Jefferson Parish Public School System.</p>
<p>The mission of the charter schools team is to increase the number of high-quality schools available to students and families in Jefferson Parish. The charter schools team specifically focuses on empowering and holding accountable charter schools, publicly-funded schools that are run independently of the school district.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The charter schools team serves several roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selecting and authorizing new charter schools.</strong> The charter schools team selects new schools from those that apply to Jefferson Parish based on the needs of the community and the quality of applications.</li>
<li><strong>Holding charter schools accountable for student success.</strong> Charter schools have greater accountability than traditional public schools because they operate on performance-based contracts. The charter schools team sets clear expectations for school performance, provides ongoing feedback to charter schools during the year, and finally assesses charter schools against the criteria for success. Holding schools accountable also means closing schools that are not helping all students achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Helping families find the best school.</strong> The charter schools team helps families learn about charter schools in Jefferson Parish and find the school option that is best for their students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Charter School?</h2>
<p>Open-enrollment charter schools are free public schools that have the flexibility to adapt to the educational needs of individual students. Open-enrollment charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students with different needs and interests. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools.</p>
<p>Just like traditional public schools, charter schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students, and operate under and receive accountability ratings from the Louisiana Department of Education. Both charter and traditional public school students take the LEAP test. Charter schools in Jefferson Parish are authorized by the Jefferson Parish School Board to provide additional high-quality options to Jefferson Parish families and students.</p>
<p>Charter school leaders make decisions that are mission-driven and centered on the needs of the students in that school. They include choices concerning mission, curriculum, professional development, report card formats, and hiring. Families can choose charter schools based on their mission, their academic performance, their school culture, or even their location; prospective students are not required to attend the neighborhood district school.</p>
<p>To learn more about charter schools in Louisiana, visit the <a href=""http://lacharterschools.org/"">Louisiana Association of Public Charter Schools</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Helpful Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any child eligible to attend public school in Jefferson Parish is also eligible to attend the district’s charter schools. Charter schools cannot discriminate based on race, gender, or achievement measures.</li>
<li>If the number of interested students for a charter school exceeds the number of available seats, the school will conduct a lottery to randomly select students to admit.</li>
<li>If you are interested in applying to any charter school, you should contact the school directly for information about the application and enrollment timeline and process. Most of the charter schools in Jefferson Parish run their application process early in the calendar year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9th Grade High School Choice</strong></p>
<p>In February 2020, JPS implemented the 9th Grade High School Choice Program (9th Grade HSCP) to allow current JPS 8th Grade Students to apply for a Jefferson Parish high school outside of their Attendance Zone for the upcoming school year. 9th Grade HSCP does not remove attendance and transportation zone schools. All students will have an enrollment seat in their traditional attendance zone school. </p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>It is the policy of Jefferson Parish Schools that discipline be defined as essential to the orderly operation of any school and the maintenance of an environment conducive to quality education. Discipline is behavior in accord with rules of conduct. A student is required to conduct himself/herself properly while under school supervision and to comply with all policies and regulations declared to govern pupil conduct. Each student shall be held strictly accountable for any disorderly conduct in school buildings, on school premises, on school buses, and at school-sanctioned events. Any violations of the code of conduct should be reported to the school administration.</p>
<p>Any violation of a code of conduct article may result in disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>Detention</h2>
<p>Before or after-school detentions of an hour or less or Saturday detentions may be assigned either by the teacher or administrator. The parent/legal guardian is notified by means of a detention notice at least one (1) day before the detention is to be served. Two (2) copies of the detention notice will be sent home with the student. One (1) copy is to be retained by the parent/legal guardian. One (1) copy should be signed by the parent/legal guardian and returned to school before the detention is to be served. The parent/legal guardian can legally refuse to allow the student to serve detentions. However, the student will be subject to suspension from school.</p>

<h2>In-School Suspension</h2>
<p>ISS allows students to remain under the school’s supervision during the suspension, to receive counseling related to specific behaviors, and to work on academic skills by completing assignments and/or general academic packets. After successfully completing the ISS, the student may return to the regular school/schedule and will be eligible to complete all missed assignments. The absence(s), according to state guidelines, is an excused absence.</p>
<h2>Out-of-School Suspension</h2>
<p>OSS removes student from the campus for a period not to exceed 10 consecutive school days. The student may return to the regular school after a conference is held with school administration and the parent or guardian and the time assigned has been completed. The student is eligible to complete all missed assignments and the absence(s), according to state guidelines, is a non-exempted absence.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is part of the District Affairs Unit of the Jefferson Parish  Schools.</li>
<li>Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports provides an operational framework for improving student academic and behavior outcomes.</li>
<li>It ensures all students have access to the most effective and accurately implemented instructional and behavioral practices and interventions.</li>
<li>PBIS is NOT a curriculum, but IS a decision-making framework that guides selection, integration and implementation of the best evidence-based academic and behavioral practices for improving academic and behavioral outcomes for all students.</li>
<li>The basic PBIS approach is to use proactive, research-based strategies to teach clearly defined behavioral expectations.</li>
<li>It establishes ongoing behavior supports that can be used by ALL students, staff, parents, volunteers, and community members.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does PBIS Work?</h2>
<p>Research shows that when a school environment is positive and predictable, students feel safe, have better academic performance, higher test results and make better behavior choices. Schools also show a gain in instructional time and a reduction in discipline referrals and out of school suspensions.</p>
<h2>PBIS in JP Schools</h2>
<p>JPS has a PBIS District Coordinator that coordinates trainings, supports schools, and serves as a liaison between the district and the LDOE. Each school in JPS has a Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports Team comprised of a team leader, an administrator, faculty and staff members representing various grade levels and departments of the school, and support personnel.</p>
<h2><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Schools will be reimbursed for subs for all trainings offered through Region 1 Consortium funds when attending during school hours. </h2>

<h2>Vector Training - (Previously Safe Schools)</h2>
<p>Click <a href=""https://jppss-la.safeschools.com/login"">here</a> to access the Vector Training site.

<h3><strong>Bullying Prevention</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><br/>What is Bullying?</strong></h3>
<p>Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Bullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>Children at risk of being bullied</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, children who are bullied have one or more of the following risk factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider “cool”</li>
<li>Are perceived as weak or unable to defend themselves</li>
<li>Are depressed, anxious, or have low self esteem</li>
<li>Are less popular than others and have few friends</li>
<li>Do not get along well with others, seen as annoying or provoking, or antagonize others for attention</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><br/>Signs to look out for</strong></h3>
<p>Some signs that may point to a bullying problem are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexplainable injuries</li>
<li>Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry</li>
<li>Frequent headaches or stomach aches, feeling sick or faking illness</li>
<li>Changes in eating habits, like suddenly skipping meals or binge eating. Kids may come home from school hungry because they did not eat lunch</li>
<li>Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares</li>
<li>Declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school</li>
<li>Sudden loss of friends or avoidance of social situations</li>
<li>Feelings of helplessness or decreased self esteem</li>
<li>Self-destructive behaviors such as running away from home, harming themselves, or talking about suicide</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><br/>What can you do for your child?<br/><br/></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Recognize the warning signs that your child is involved in bullying. They could be being bullied, bullying others, or witnessing bullying. Although these signs could signal other issues, you should talk to your child if they display any sort of behavioral or emotional changes. Many times kids won’t ask for help, so it is important to know what to look for. If your child is at immediate risk of harming himself or others, get help right away</li>
<li>Learn what bullying is and what it is not. Understanding what bullying is is the first step in forming a plan to prevent or respond to bullying with your child. Many behaviors that look like bullying may be just as serious, but may require different response strategies</li>
<li>Help kids understand bullying. Talk about what bullying is and how to stand up to it safely. Tell kids bullying is unacceptable. Make sure kids know how to get help</li>
<li>Keep the lines of communication open. Check in with kids often. Listen to them. Know their friends, ask about school, and understand their concerns</li>
<li>Encourage kids to do what they love. Special activities, interests, and hobbies can boost confidence, help kids make friends, and protect them from bullying behavior</li>
<li>Model how to treat others with kindness and respect</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><br/>Do you know a bully or a person who is being bullied?</strong></h3>
<p>Your child’s school has a designated area to report bullying. Students will remain safe and anonymous. For more information, contact your child’s school.</p>

<h1>Where does bullying happen?</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Bullying can happen anywhere. It can occur in your neighborhood, while going to school, at school, and while online.</p>



</li>
</ul>















<h1>Who gets bullied?</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>ANYONE! Anyone from the shy, quiet class mate to the most popular kid. It can be girls, boys, a Pre-K student or a senior. Someone in the band or someone that plays sports.<br/><br/>Everyone can be a target, but no one deserves to be.</p>



</li>
</ul>















<h1>How can you tell who is a bully?</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Watch their actions. Listen to their words. Do they hurt or harm you or someone you know? Is that person able to defend themselves against those actions or words?<br/><br/>“It’s no big deal!” Bullies don’t think that what they are doing is wrong. When is hurting someone ever “no big deal?”<br/><br/>Think about it! If you just stopped to think twice about what you were saying or doing, you could change the words or actions to be more positive ones.</p>



</li>
</ul>















<h1>Speak up!</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<ul>
<li>You can make all the difference<br/>by reporting bullying</li>
<li>No one should accept or even tolerate bullying at your school</li>
<li>If one person speaks out, others will too</li>
<li>No one deserves to be bullied!</li>
</ul>

<p>College Ready</p>
<p>When students graduate college ready, they leave high school with the knowledge, skills and behavior necessary to complete basic freshman level college coursework. Let’s break down these three basics of college readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge<br/></strong>In Louisiana, college bound students should work towards achieving a TOPS University Diploma. This diploma includes the common core requirements for college entrance. Student knowledge in these courses is assessed through GPA and assessments (ACT/SAT).</p>
<p><strong>Skills<br/></strong>College ready skills include things like critical thinking, time management, communication and decision making. These skills can be exemplified through a student’s ability to write a well-structured essay, complete mathematical formulas, use the scientific method and work through real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong>Behavior<br/></strong>The transition from high school to college can be challenging for some students, which is why it’s critical that we support our students in building healthy behaviors to help them succeed in life. These behaviors can include resilience, positivity, interpersonal relationships and habits to remain healthy and thrive socially, emotionally and academically.</p>
<p>Jefferson Parish Schools offers varying degrees of advanced coursework including AP Classes and CLEP, to expose students to the rigors of college courses. In addition to boosting a student’s application to college, these courses can help teach essential skills, such as perseverance, time management and effective study strategies, that will help students succeed in a college setting.</p>

<h1>University of New Orleans Offers Automatic Admission to All Jefferson Parish Schools Graduates</h1>
<p>The University of New Orleans (UNO) has partnered with Jefferson Parish Schools to offer automatic admission for all graduates who meet enrollment criteria through a new Instant Admit program.</p>
<p>“Attaining post-secondary education or training can help our students land the job that fits their passions, increase their earning potential and contribute to long-term career success. We are proud to partner with the University of New Orleans to help students achieve their goals and make enrolling in college accessible and affordable,” said Dr. James Gray, Superintendent of Jefferson Parish Schools. “When our students choose local colleges and careers, the entire region benefits from a more educated workforce and engaged citizens with a vested interest in their community.”</p>
<p>“The University of New Orleans is proud to partner with Jefferson Parish Schools to remove barriers and increase access to a high-quality college education right here in New Orleans,” said UNO President John Nicklow. “A degree from UNO has the ability to transform students’ lives by putting them on a path to a fulfilling career without the burden of excessive debt.”</p>

<p><strong>Diploma Pathways</strong></p>
<p>The Louisiana Department of Education recognizes two high school diplomas - the TOPS Tech Diploma and the TOPS University Diploma. Both diplomas meet statewide graduation requirements, but they differ in that one focuses on college preparation while the other focuses on entering the workforce.</p>
<p>During the first two years of high school, all students will take core academic classes that focus on building the knowledge and skills they gained in previous grades. Following the student’s tenth grade year, s/he will choose a high school pathway that results in either a TOPS Tech Diploma or a TOPS University Diploma. Students may also choose to work towards achieving both diplomas. Decisions are made with counseling and guidance, based on the student’s interests, capabilities, and ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>What is a TOPS University Diploma?</strong><br/>The TOPS University Diploma ensures students receive college preparatory curriculum and required courses to enroll in a traditional four-year university, while also making sure they have every chance possible to receive TOPS scholarship awards, including TOPS Opportunity, TOPS Performance, TOPS Honors and TOPS Tech. The majority of students enrolled in Jefferson Parish Schools graduate with a TOPS University diploma.</p>

<p><strong>What is a TOPS Tech Diploma?</strong></p>
<p>The TOPS Tech Diploma ensures students receive business credentials and training while also making sure they have every chance possible to receive a TOPS Tech scholarship award. In Jefferson Parish, nearly half of our students enter the workforce immediately upon graduation. Students who graduate with a TOPS Tech diploma will exit high school prepared to enter the workforce or continue their education through a community or technical college.</p>

<p>Testing</p>
<p>Jefferson Parish Schools uses nationally recognized assessments to measure a student’s readiness for a career and college. These include the ACT, SAT and ACT WorkKeys. Students should begin planning and preparing to take these exams early in high school with a goal of taking the test at least once in eleventh grade. That way, the student has ample opportunity to retest and improve his/her score before graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Should I take the ACT, SAT or ACT WorkKeys?</strong></p>
<p>The state of Louisiana mandates the ACT for all eleventh grade students, meaning the test is paid for and administered by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. Results from both the ACT and ACT WorkKeys are used to measure school performance statewide.</p>
<p>The ACT and SAT measure a student’s college readiness and cover generally the same topics. Both the ACT and SAT are accepted by all four-year colleges and universities including all Ivy League schools. Some students find that they do better on one than the other, so it may be advisable to take a practice test for both and compare your scores.</p>
<p>The ACT WorkKeys is a supplemental assessment to the ACT and measures the foundational skills required for success in the workplace. It can be used as a resume builder and to obtain additional scholarship money through TOPS Tech.</p>

<p><strong>ACT Fee Waiver Program</strong></p>
<p>Students having difficulty paying for the ACT, can apply for the ACT Fee Waiver program. The free waiver program covers the cost of taking the ACT up to four times and free learning resources. To be eligible, the student must be enrolled in 11th or 12th grade and also meet one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled in a federal free or reduced-price lunch program.</li>
<li>Enrolled in a program for the economically disadvantaged (for example, a federally funded program such as GEAR UP or Upward Bound).</li>
<li>Resides in a foster home, is a ward of the state, or is homeless.</li>
<li>Family receives low-income public assistance or lives in federally subsidized public housing.<em><br/></em></li>

<p>ACT WorkKeys</p>
<p>The ACT WorkKeys is a supplemental assessment to the ACT and can be used to obtain additional scholarship money through TOPS Tech for community colleges and some four year colleges. The ACT WorkKeys also provides students with a college and job “resume builder.” The assessments measure foundational skills required for success in the workplace, and help measure the skills that can affect job performance. WorkKeys assessments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>—WorkKeys assessments are developed to solve actual workplace problems. Unlike other assessments, they don’t simply give an indication of reading and writing competency. Instead, they measure a range of hard and soft skills relevant to any occupation, at any level, and across industries.</li>
<li><strong>Recognized</strong>—Successful completion of WorkKeys core assessments can lead to earning an ACT WorkKeys National Career Readiness Certificate—a credential that verifies the skills found to be most essential across industries and occupations. Tens of thousands of employers recognize the value of the NCRC, and many recommend the credential to candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each assessment offers varying levels of difficulty. The levels build on each other, incorporating the skills assessed at the previous levels. For example, at Level 5, individuals need the skills from Levels 3, 4, and 5. The complexity increases as the quantity and/or density of the information increases.</p>
<p>There are three subtests of the ACT WorkKeys assessment: Workplace Documents, Graphic Literacy and Applied Math. Students will have 55 minutes to complete each subtest. Based on their performance on these tests, students will receive a level score of 3-7 for each. Based on your three level scores, you receive a WorkKeys Designation.</p>

<h3><strong>Financial Aid</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Louisiana’s Financial Aid Access Policy for High School Seniors</strong></h3>
<p>Most Louisiana high school graduates are eligible for some form of merit- or need-based financial aid. Students can apply for state and federal financial aid by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which can be used at four-year universities, two-year community colleges, and technical training programs. The FAFSA is used to determine the amount of money a family is expected to contribute to the price of attending a post-secondary institution, and the results of the FAFSA are used in determining student grants, work-study, and educational loan amounts.</p>
<h3>Louisiana requires public school students to take one of the following steps:</h3>

<h1>School Emergency Information Guide for Parents &amp; Guardians</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<h3><strong>Parent Responsibilities During a School Emergency</strong></h3>
<p>As a parent, your initial reaction is to report to the school; however, calling the school repeatedly or rushing to the school to pick up your child creates more confusion for a school in a state of emergency.</p>
<p>During a school emergency, it is crucial that roadways are clear for first responders to reach the school as quickly as possible. Parents on the scene often hinder police, fire and EMT rescue attempts. As emotionally difficult as it may be, parents should wait for official communications from school or public safety officials.</p>
<p>The JP Schools Communications Department will publish emergency notification alerts with official verified news and updates of the incident. JCampus notifications will be sent via text, email and voice message to the contact information that was filed with the school. Parents are responsible for schools having correct and updated contact information.</p>
<h3><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></h3>
<p>BE PREPARED FOR A SCHOOL EMERGENCY</p>
<p>Ensure that your child's emergency contact information is accurate and current on the emergency card.</p>
<p>All student contact information should be up to date within the school's data base. Parents are urged to log into their child's STUDENT PROGRESS CENTER (an option found within the JP Schools mobile app) to verify and update contact information on file. Contact information can also be updated at child's school.</p>
<p>The district uses a notification system within the JCampus Student Database to notify parents of inclement weather and emergencies.</p>
<p>Become familiar with your school's emergency communication procedures. Each school is committed to providing accurate and timely information in the event of an emergency.</p>
<h3><strong>Reasons for Students and Staff to be on Lockdown, Lockout or an Evacuation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Environmental event; gas leak, chemical spill, etc. Weather Emergency; tornado, flash floods</li>
<li>Intruder near or in the campus area</li>
</ul>
<p>A call for lockdown, lockout, or evacuation will take place when there is an internal or external threat identified. If a threat is identified, law enforcement personnel are to eliminate the threat, EMS and fire responders will render first aid if necessary and ensure the safety of classrooms and buildings for normal operation.</p>
<h3><strong>Reunification After an Emergency</strong></h3>
<p>The process for reunification with your child after an emergency will be communicated to families after an ""all clear"" has been provided by authorities.</p>
<p>Parents must remember arriving at the school site for reunification may interfere with first responders. Reunification is possible when the ""all clear"" has been given. Parents must remember to bring proper identification. Students will only be released to parents/ guardians with proper documentation.</p>
<p>In the event an evacuation takes place, the location site for reunification will be communicated to families. If students are not evacuated, JP Schools will transport students who normally ride a bus.</p>
<p>It is important that parents update their contact information in JCampus in order to receive updates.</p>
<p>We will also use the JP Schools mobile app, website, local news, and text messages to communicate with parents/guardians.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Jefferson Parish Schools Food Services Department is responsible for preparing and serving meals offered to students and staff throughout the district. Breakfast and lunch are offered in all schools. Students are offered a variety of healthy meals daily. Menus are planned following United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines with an emphasis on the use of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Modified menus for students with dietary restrictions are also available. Contact Jamie Hooks, LDN, RD at 504-349-7768  for more information.</p>
<p>Please note that last minute menu changes may occur at our schools due to nationwide food supply chain issues. Menus on the district website may not reflect these changes. If you have any questions regarding your school's menu, please reach out to your school's cafeteria manager. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.  </p>
<h2>Programs &amp; Services</h2>
<p>USDA has extended free meals for <strong>ALL</strong> students through the 2021-2022 school year.<strong>  </strong>However, families are still encouraged to complete a <a href=""https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01"">free and reduced meal application</a>. These applications support our meal program and help determine additional school funding. Questions regarding meal eligibilities or free and reduced meal applications should be made to Daytona Tucker, Applications Manager, at 504-349-7687.</p>
<p>The direct website link to the Free and Reduced Online Application is <a href=""https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01"">https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01</a></p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Jefferson Parish Schools Food Services Department is responsible for preparing and serving meals offered to students and staff throughout the district. Breakfast and lunch are offered in all schools. Students are offered a variety of healthy meals daily. Menus are planned following United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines with an emphasis on the use of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Modified menus for students with dietary restrictions are also available. Contact Jamie Hooks, LDN, RD at 504-349-7768  for more information.</p>
<p>Please note that last minute menu changes may occur at our schools due to nationwide food supply chain issues. Menus on the district website may not reflect these changes. If you have any questions regarding your school's menu, please reach out to your school's cafeteria manager. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.  </p>
<h2>Programs &amp; Services</h2>
<p>USDA has extended free meals for <strong>ALL</strong> students through the 2021-2022 school year.<strong>  </strong>However, families are still encouraged to complete a <a href=""https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01"">free and reduced meal application</a>. These applications support our meal program and help determine additional school funding. Questions regarding meal eligibilities or free and reduced meal applications should be made to Daytona Tucker, Applications Manager, at 504-349-7687.</p>
<p>The direct website link to the Free and Reduced Online Application is <a href=""https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01"">https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01</a></p>

<p>NBC Learn K-12 (www.archives.nbclearn.com) is a multi-media collection of more than 14,000 videos, documents and images from NBC News. In addition to historic primary-source newscasts from the NBC News archive, NBC Learn K-12 is updated daily with current events drawn from the programs and platforms of NBC News. The resources in NBC Learn K-12 are aligned to curriculum as well as correlated to Louisiana State Standards and the Louisiana Common Core Standards. Videos can be streamed, downloaded, and integrated into on-line learning management tools.</p>
<p>JPPSS Middle and High Schools now have access to NBC Learn thanks to a partnership with the United States Golf Association (USGA) and Chevron Corporation. They’ve come together to create NBC Learn’s newest original series, ""The Science of Golf,"" focusing on STEM through the lens of one of American’s most popular sports. Along with The Science of Golf, all Middle and High Schools in the district have free access to thousands of videos on NBC Learn.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #20: - 6/12/20 Latest on JP Schools Reopening Plans for 2020-21</h1>

<p>JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>We’re less than two months away from the start of a new school year. While it’s our intention to begin classes in-person August 6, we’re preparing for a number of scenarios depending on the status of the health pandemic. Regardless of what August 6 looks like, we will be ready to educate kids on day one. That’s our commitment.</p>
<p>Another commitment we’ve made is to keep our families informed throughout this process. We’d like to share with you some of the plans we have in place for reopening schools. It was developed following the most recent CDC Guidance for Reopening Schools. </p>
<p>Any scenario that involves students attending school in-person will include the following safety precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students and staff will be required to wear face coverings</li>
<li>Social distancing protocols established and communicated with all stakeholders</li>
<li>Temperature checks for all students, employees, and visitors</li>
<li>Teachers and staff members ensure students follow all COVID-19 safety measures</li>
<li>Students follow altered routines for lunch, restroom breaks, bus un/loading, and other travel patterns</li>
<li>Bus capacity will be limited when necessary to ensure all students can arrive at school safely, on time, and following CDC guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re preparing for three possible scenarios to open the year: traditional, hybrid/blended, and 100% virtual. The district will be prepared to immediately shift to virtual instruction should school closure become necessary during the school year. Some of the details of our three reopening scenarios include:</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students attend school five days a week using additional safety precautions</li>
<li>Staff report to school daily</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid/Blended Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Student attend school 2-3 days of the week and receive virtual instruction the other days of the week</li>
<li>District will support families to meet their technology needs</li>
<li>Staff report to school daily and provide in-person and virtual instruction and support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students do not report to school and receive instruction 100% virtual</li>
<li>District will support families to meet their technology needs</li>
<li>Staff report to school on predetermined days</li>
<li>Staff provide support and synchronous instruction via Google Meet and asynchronous instruction via Google Classroom</li>
</ul>
<p>These plans only pertain to opening schools. We will continue to provide guidance throughout the summer regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated safety measures</li>
<li>Attendance requirements</li>
<li>Student recovery for unfinished learning</li>
<li>Preparing students and teachers for various learning methods</li>
<li>Social/emotional learning</li>
<li>Staff and student policies and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our students and staff is our top priority. Our school-based plans will be fluid and routinely adjusted to reflect updated national, state, and local guidance. We know our families and employees have many questions about what the new school year will look like. As we get answers, we will share that information. The district will also begin surveying families about their individual needs in the coming weeks. This will help us make better decisions as we move forward. </p>
<p>We are excited to continue working together to ensure we provide students with the education they deserve to succeed in life and make the world a better place. Jefferson Parish Schools is committed to doing whatever it takes to Start Strong in 2020 and ensure a great 20-21 school year!</p>
<p>Jefferson Parish Schools</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #19: - 5/22/20 General Updates for Summer &amp; Next School year</h1>

<p><b>2020-21 SCENARIOS<br/></b>While ideally we are able to start the year face-to-face, we know that there will likely be changes in how we operate schools next year. There are a few different scenarios for how that may look. This could include face-to-face with additional safety guidelines, engaging students with a hybrid of virtual and face-to-face, or having an as-needed virtual learning environment. We will make a final decision on how we will start the year based on the guidance of local, state, and national health officials. If we are able to begin the school year face-to-face, it will be imperative that educators devote portions of their day to practice virtual lessons in the classroom with students. Should the need arise to shift to a virtual model during the school year, the expectation is to do so as seamlessly as possible. </p>
<p>If you’ve not already, one way you can help us plan is by <a href=""https://k12.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e55f3674f3b8aa800c9f127e4&amp;id=43d3f7410c&amp;e=1eb12f5026"">taking this stakeholder survey</a>. We want your feedback to let us know what’s worked and what we can do better heading into 2020-21. Thank you to the over 7,000 stakeholders who have already offered your input.</p>
<p><b>DECREASED REVENUE<br/></b>We must further reduce expenditures due to the significant decline in our revenue from the stalled economy. Approximately 40% of the district’s revenue comes from sales tax. As the economy has stalled, our estimates show that this could result in a revenue decline of at least $12 million for our district. Any expenditure reduction plan will support our two biggest priorities - student learning and the health and safety of our kids. We previously reduced $16 million from our budget in March. </p>
<p><b>SCHOOL START TIMES<br/></b>Changing the start times for some of our schools was included in the <i>2020 Infrastructure and Efficiency Plan</i> passed by our School Board in March. Based on research and parent feedback, we have made changes to school start times. <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/schooltimes"">You can view the new school times here</a> or click one of the following links: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jpp1w1oO91NKfqpuH7O8LxySbV-kaoEI"">East Bank</a> | <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bIsOswIAtJKT_N9JvYoinq-9BPjlWGb9"">West Bank</a>. These will go into effect for the 2020-21 school year. Where possible, we are starting elementary schools earlier and high schools later. We believe this will support working parents of elementary students and lead to stronger outcomes for high school students. This will also help us financially through more efficient use of buses and routes. Based on schedules, schools will adjust before and after care programs and extracurricular activities accordingly. </p>
<p><b>GRAB &amp; GO <br/></b>Our Grab &amp; Go meal program will continue through the summer. The meal locations and times will remain the same. Meals will be available to families at our 13 Grab &amp; Go sites Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays this summer from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Families will be provided enough meals for all seven days of the week. Children will receive breakfast and lunch for that day and the following day on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, children will receive enough breakfasts and lunches to last through the weekend. For more information about this program, visit <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/grabandgo"">jpschools.org/GrabAndGo</a>.</p>
<p><b>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT LINE<br/></b>This is the final week for our academic support line, but our emotional support line will remain available to employees and families through the summer. You can call (504) 349-7629 weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or between 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p><b>EARLY START JEFFERSON &amp; LEAP REMEDIATION<br/></b>As we approach the summer months, we want to offer an additional educational opportunity for our struggling students. Early Start Jefferson will invite students in grades K-5 who are below proficiency in math and/or ELA to participate in a program the two weeks before the start of next school year. The program will offer either an in-person or completely virtual model. We have communicated information about Early Start Jefferson to school leaders and they are identifying students who would benefit from this program. We are also seeking current JP employees to work our Early Start Jefferson program. If interested, please apply via this link:<a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFZmCjmQPR6TInkIMKYY613w3aUxmeXUbskNHg-nY8XoDg7w/viewform""> Early Start JPS Employment Application</a>. </p>
<p>We also will host remediation from June 29-July 10 for any student needing to re-take the high school LEAP test. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8YusAg1-a6Tosryrr5YfDZyvhb1Aw6P8g7nUIXLGKuJbKEg/viewform"">Students can register at this link</a>. </p>
<p><b>SUMMER CAMPS<br/></b>Jefferson Parish Schools will not operate summer camps due to COVID-19. We are partnering with Ed Navigator on their at-home program, Camp Kinda. This is a free summer experience designed to keep kids engaged, asking questions, and having fun.

<h1>Coronavirus Update #18 - 4/27/20: JP Schools Announces Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments for All Students</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has announced how it will handle student grades, grade promotion, and graduation decisions with school buildings closed through the end of the academic year. This information is available now at jpschools.org/grades. </p>
<p>“We are being intentionally student-friendly with these policy shifts. The last thing I want to do is punish a child for a situation completely out of their control,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley. “The remainder of our school year will be an opportunity for students to improve their grades for the year while continuing to learn new content.”</p>
<p>As of Monday, April 27, students can complete at-home learning assignments for a grade. These additional assignments are meant to benefit students and can only improve final grades. </p>
<p>“While these assignments are not mandatory nor required, we encourage families to participate in every learning opportunity available to maintain a continuity of learning until our last day of school on May 21,” said Dr. Brumley. “ The more our students engage academically this spring, the more ready they will be for their next grade level.” </p>
<p>Families with questions about their child’s options should email their teacher. Teacher email addresses can be found on each school website. School websites are linked at jpschools.org/schools. The district has also opened a hotline for families who need academic support. The hotline number is 504-349-8999. The call center will be open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The full grading and promotion adjustments can be viewed at jpschools.org/grades.</p>
<p><b>Elementary and Middle School Students</b></p>
<p>Students with internet access should continue accessing and utilizing online resources at jpschools.org/learnathome.  Students without internet access should complete a third round at-home learning packet to receive a 4th quarter grade. Packets will be available April 28 and 30 at all Grab &amp; Go sites.</p>
<p><b>High School Students</b></p>
<p>High school students will be given the opportunity to complete online at-home learning activities to improve their grades. Students who were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits. If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, their final grades will be averages of the previous quarters. </p>
<p>High school seniors may elect to receive either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits. If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing the short Google Form at jpschools.org/grades.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #16 - 4/22/20: JP Schools Announces Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments for High School Students</h1>

<p><strong>Awarding Carnegie Credit and Graduation Guidance for Families</strong></p>
<p>Regulatory course adjustments have been granted due to the current school closures. These adjustments will enable students to complete the school year and graduate without penalty. </p>
<p><strong>ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will students meet credit requirements?</strong></p>
<p>The final grade for the semester will average the 3rd quarter grade with the 4th quarter online learning activities. The online learning activities shall not negatively impact the final grade. The completion of online learning activities will only serve to improve a grade, not lower a grade. </p>
<p><strong>Are the</strong> <strong>4th quarter</strong> <strong>at-home learning assignments mandatory?</strong></p>
<p>These assignments are encouraged but are not mandatory nor required. Students are being given the opportunity to improve their final grades with the at-home activities.  However, students that were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits.</p>
<p>If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, his/her final grades will be averages of the previous quarter(s). </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is currently failing a course?</strong></p>
<p>Students that have not met proficiency (have an F average) must complete the course in PLATO. For information about joining PLATO, families/students should contact their teacher.</p>
<p><strong>How does the waiver of attendance requirements impact students?</strong></p>
<p>Instructional minute and compulsory attendance requirements have been waived for the year.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a dual enrollment course with a college or university?</strong></p>
<p>The following three options have been approved for Dual Enrollment students: </p>
<ul>
<li>Continue the course via distance learning options through the higher education institution and earn credit when the course ends; </li>
<li>Opt for an “In Progress” designation and have until August 31, 2020, to complete the course and earn credit; or </li>
<li>Opt for an “Administrative Withdrawal” and exit the course with no credit and nothing posted to the official college transcript.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can students still take the Advanced Placement tests?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  A new (at home) online test is available to allow students the opportunity to earn college credit and placement. Contact your school counselor for more information or visit the <a href=""https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/exam-dates-and-fees?affiliateId=ap%7Chome&amp;bannerId=cal%7Capc-examdates"">AP website </a>for testing information. </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a ½ credit course?</strong></p>
<p>Students enrolled in a ½ credit course for the 4th quarter must complete the course assignments in PLATO or Google Classroom to be awarded credit.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student completed an at-home learning packet?</strong></p>
<p>The at-home learning packets distributed at our 13 Grab and Go sites will not be graded nor counted towards a 4th quarter grade. These packets are for academic enrichment purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>SENIORS ONLY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will seniors receive a letter grade or can they choose a Pass/Fail option?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Families may elect either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits.</li>
<li>Pass/Fail options are not calculated into the Grade Point Average (i.e., for the purpose of Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS), college athletic eligibility and/or academic admissions/scholarships). </li>
<li>If the Pass/Fail option is chosen, all spring semester courses will be awarded the grade of Pass/Fail. A Pass/Fail acknowledgment form must be requested from the high school.</li>
<li>If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing<a href=""https://forms.gle/EPipELPUokz9WqeB8""> this short Google Form</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do seniors still need to complete the financial aid requirement?</strong></p>
<p>No. The financial aid planning graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors.  Despite this requirement being waived, families are encouraged to apply online by visiting <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"">the FAFSA website</a>.  </p>
<p>In addition to state financial aid programs (e.g. TOPS and LA Go Grant), there are Federal Student Aid programs that require FAFSA completion, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pell Grant</li>
<li>Supplemental Education Opportunity Program/SEOG</li>
<li>Federal Work Study</li>
<li>Federal Direct Loans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a senior needs a LEAP 2025 high school assessment score to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The spring LEAP 2025 assessment window has been cancelled, and the requirement has been waived for currently enrolled graduating seniors. The senior waivers apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any current student, enrolled as of February 1, that would be classified as a senior at any time during the current school year with the necessary credits to graduate</li>
<li>Graduating seniors eligible under ACT 833</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a TOPS Tech Diploma senior needs an IBC credential to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The IBC terminal graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors. Graduating seniors will be eligible to graduate with a TOPS Tech Diploma without earning the IBC credential. </p>
<p><strong>Is there an exception for the TOPS Core GPA due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>No. TOPS requires a minimum TOPS Core GPA of 2.50.  This requirement still applies even if a student chooses to receive Pass/Fail grades from the high school.  Parents should take this into account and make careful consideration before selecting this option.</p>
<p><strong>If seniors have not had the opportunity to take the ACT, will this be waived so these students can graduate?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Seniors are not required to test as a condition of graduation. However, ACT exam options are available in June 2020 if students want to take the exam to qualify for TOPS eligibility.  </p>
<p><strong>What if a senior cannot meet the 25-hour requirement to earn a Community Service Seal due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>The 25-hour requirement has been waived for 2019-2020 seniors.  If students have met the requirements for their freshmen sophomore, and junior years, they may be awarded the diploma seal.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #15 - 4/16/20: Jefferson Parish Schools Moves Class of 2020 Graduations to July</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools is moving its high school graduations to July in an effort to preserve in-person commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2020. The district announced that graduations for 14 of its 15 senior classes will now take place in July. </p>
<p>“Senior year is one of the most memorable times of our kids’ lives, and the pinnacle of this time is the commencement ceremony,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley. “We’re doing everything in our power to make this moment special for the Class of 2020. Our seniors deserve a traditional graduation and I want to do all we can to make that possible.“ </p>
<p>District leaders made the switch with the hope it will be safe to gather for an appropriate celebration by July. Commencement ceremonies for all JP Schools graduating classes except Grand Isle School, JCFA Charter, and Kenner Discovery Charter High will take place July 6-9 at the Pontchartrain Center. Should it not be safe to hold in-person commencement ceremonies by July, the schools will instead hold virtual graduations in mid-July. Grand Isle School will hold its ceremony in the school’s gymnasium July 10. Kenner Discovery Charter High will be releasing information soon about their graduation plans.  JCFA Charter will hold its graduation July 14 at La Maison Creole in Harvey.</p>
<p>The ceremonies will be abbreviated and include additional safety measures. Speeches and performances will be limited and invitations will be reduced. The district will record each graduation and make those videos available online. Schools will communicate information about diploma pick-up and commencement ceremonies to families. The district is announcing this change now to give families as much notice as possible.</p>
<p>JP Schools commencement ceremonies were scheduled to start May 9 and conclude May 17. There are over 2,600 high school seniors in Jefferson Parish Schools. Fifteen schools in the district have a 2020 graduating class: Bonnabel High, East Jefferson High, Fisher Middle-High, Grace King High, Grand Isle School, Haynes Academy, Helen Cox High, Higgins High, JCFA Charter, John Ehret High, Kenner Discovery Charter High, Patrick F. Taylor Academy, Thomas Jefferson Academy, and West Jefferson High.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #14 - 4/15/20: All Louisiana School Buildings Will Remain Closed Through the Remainder of the 2019-20 School Year</h1>

<p>Dear JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Today, Governor Edwards announced that all Louisiana school buildings will remain closed through the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. This is difficult news to hear, but we fully support the Governor’s decision. The safety of our students and employees is our top responsibility. Our state has made great progress towards flattening the curve, and we all must do everything in our power to ensure the trend continues.</p>
<p>This announcement means our buildings remain closed. As we have learned over the past month, “school” is much more than a building. School will continue until students’ last day on May 21. Just like it has throughout the closure, learning will continue in Jefferson Parish Schools. Our at-home learning resources are available to students in multiple forms and delivery methods.</p>
<p>Families with internet access should visit <a href=""http://jpschools.org/LearnAtHome"">jpschools.org/LearnAtHome</a>. That’s our digital hub for a diverse offering of lessons, daily schedules, as well as self-guided, student-specific online programs. We also encourage families to email their teachers, as many educators have started offering online lessons through Google Classroom. Since schools closed in mid-March, we have trained over 2,000 educators (and counting) on Google Classroom. </p>
<p>For our families without the technology to access online resources, we will distribute a final round of learning packets at our Grab &amp; Go sites April 28 and 30 that will last through the end of the school year. We will also announce information this week about a laptop loaner program for the final five weeks of school. </p>
<p>Our Grab &amp; Go sites will provide meals on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule through the end of the school year. We will also maintain operation of our academic and emotional support call centers. </p>
<p>I know you have questions about what this means for your child. As a parent of school-age children, I share many of your same concerns. Louisiana is not the first state to make this difficult decision, and it won’t be the last. As we began seeing states make this call and the number of coronavirus cases rise in our region, we started planning for this possibility. Continue to visit <a href=""http://jpschools.org/coronavirus"">jpschools.org/coronavirus</a> for the most recent district updates, resources, and a running list of frequently asked questions. Teachers and principals will also be available via email for school specific questions.</p>
<p>Your school will be your first line of communication. We all learned about the Governor’s decision today during his public announcement. This includes our principals, teachers, and support staff. They will be in contact with families about what this means for their child. Please be patient as our educators learn and prepare information to share. If you haven’t done so before, make a habit of regularly visiting your school’s website. Those web addresses can be found at <a href=""http://jpschools.org/schools"">jpschools.org/schools</a>.</p>
<p>I wish we had answers to all your questions right now, but we don’t. We have done our best to prepare for this situation while simultaneously leading the district through day-to-day realities of this unprecedented public health crisis. There are many moving parts and pieces. We want to make sure they all fit and work smoothly together. Please continue to check our website, free Jefferson Parish School mobile app, and our social media pages for the latest updates. As we learn more information, we will share it with you. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #13 - 4/9/20: LHSAA Announces Cancellation of Remaining Winter &amp; Spring Sports</h1>

<p>The Louisiana High School Athletic Association has made the decision to cancel all remaining winter and spring sports for the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>""This decision was not in haste and was discussed with tremendous concern for those senior athletes being affected,"" said LHSAA Executive Director Eddie Bonine. ""We realize and concur with the argument about retuning to normalcy and allowing seniors to have their moment, just like we did for boys' basketball championships, unfortunately, circumstances today are tremendously different than circumstances were that week in March. We understand the hardships and disappointments everyone, especially the class of 2020, is enduring due to the closure of schools facilities, but our unwavering focus must now remain on doing our part by continuing to follow any and all mitigation measures set forth by our Governor.""</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #12 - 4/6/20: Jefferson Parish Schools Recognizing Spring Break April 10-14</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools will recognize its originally scheduled Spring Break April 10-14. While all schools and buildings are already closed until at least April 30 due to the Governor's proclamation, all JP Schools employees will be off for Spring Break. Employees have been working remotely where possible. </p>
<p>The district will not operate Grab &amp; Go meal sites or its academic and emotional support call centers during Spring Break. Teachers and administrators will also not be available to families via email during the break. While families will still have access to the district's optional at-home learning resources, the district encourages students and families to also take a break from at-home learning.</p>
<p>The district will resume its regular closure activities and schedule April 15. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #11 - 4/2/20: Governor Edwards Extends School Closures Until At Least April 30</h1>

<p>Dear JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Today, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that he is extending school closures in the state until at least April 30. This coincides with President Trump’s announcement this past weekend to extend the national social distancing guidelines until April 30.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of a national health crisis, and I fully support the Governor’s decision to keep kids home. While we were prepared for schools to reopen April 15, we’ve also planned for this extension. We remain committed to providing students, families, and the community with as much support as possible during this unprecedented time.</p>
<p>We will continue to operate our Grab &amp; Go meal program and provide families with optional at-home learning resources.</p>
<p>We’ll also continue to operate our Emotional Support Line. Experienced mental health professionals are available via telephone to provide emotional support and share any pertinent resources during these difficult times. Parents of JP Schools students and staff members may call (504) 349-7629 weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p>To our high school seniors, know that you are still the Class of 2020, and I look forward to signing each and every one of your diplomas. We are working on a process to ensure you have the opportunity to graduate this spring.</p>
<p>We are working to find creative solutions during these trying times. Nothing will match the support we provide children and families when our doors are open. We know our families need us now more than ever, and we are doing everything we can to step into the gap for them.</p>
<p>I know there will be many questions and growing pains. You can find frequently asked questions and additional information at <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/coronavirus"">jpschools.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you as we continue to partner together in educating our students.</p>
<p><br/>Dr. Brumley<br/>Superintendent<br/>Jefferson Parish Schools</p>

<p>Queridos Colegas,</p>
<p>Hoy, el gobernador John Bel Edwards anuncio que extenderá el cierre de escuelas en el estado hasta al menos el 30 de abril. Esto coincide con el anuncio del Presidente Trump el pasado fin de semana de extender las guías nacionales de distanciamiento social hasta el 30 de abril.</p>
<p>Estamos en medio de una crisis nacional de salud, y apoyo totalmente la decisión del gobernador de mantener a los niños en casa. Si bien estábamos preparados para que las escuelas reabrieran el 15 de abril, también hemos planeado para esta extensión. Seguimos comprometidos a proporcionas a los estudiantes, las familias y la comunidad el mayor apoyo posible durante este tiempo sin precedente.</p>
<p>Continuaremos operando nuestro programa de comidas Grab &amp; Go y brindaremos a las familias recursos de aprendizaje en el hogar.</p>
<p>También continuaremos operando nuestra Línea de Apoyo Emocional. Profesionales con experiencia en salud mental están disponibles por teléfono para brindar apoyo emocional y compartir los recursos pertinentes durante estos tiempos difíciles. Los padres de los estudiantes y miembros del personal de las escuelas de JP pueden llamar al (504) 349-7629 de lunes a viernes de 10 a.m. a 1 p.m. o de 4 p.m. a 6 p.m. para hablar con uno de nuestros profesionales capacitados en salud mental.</p>
<p>Para nuestros estudiantes de último año de secundaria, sepan que todavía son de la clase 2020, y espero firmar todos y cada uno de sus diplomas. Estamos trabajando en un proceso para garantizar que tengan la oportunidad de graduarse esta primavera.</p>
<p>Estamos trabajando para encontrar soluciones creativas durante estos tiempos difíciles. Nada igualará el apoyo que brindamos a los niños y las familias cuando nuestras puertas estén abiertas. Sabemos que nuestras familias nos necesitan ahora más que nunca, y estamos haciendo todo lo posible para abrirnos paso por ellos.</p>
<p>Sé que habrá muchas preguntas y dolores de crecimiento. Puede encontrar preguntas frecuentes e información adicional en jpschools.org/coronavirus.</p>
<p>Gracias por todos ustedes mientras continuamos colaborando juntos en la educación de nuestros estudiantes.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #10 - 4/2/20: JP Schools Announces Friday Changes to Meals and Packet Distribution</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has announced two changes to the support it is providing families. While families will still be served meals for every day of the week at the district’s 13 Grab &amp; Go sites, weekend meals will not be provided until additional approval is granted by the USDA. The district is also consolidating its learning packet distribution to two sites for Friday: Bissonet Plaza Elementary and Gretna Middle.</p>
<p>JP Schools began a partnership with the Three O’Clock Project April 1 on its Grab &amp; Go meals program. The shift allows the district to serve the same amount of meals to students while only operating the sites three days a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). JP Schools and the Three O-Clock Project were originally given approval to serve weekend meals on Fridays. The USDA then notified the state this week that it was still weighing funding approval for the weekend meals. Families will continue to receive breakfasts and lunches for that day and the next on Monday and Wednesday, as well as lunch and breakfast on Friday. Jefferson Parish Schools has served over 125,000 meals to children since starting its Grab &amp; Go service March 18. </p>
<p>After passing out 43,000 printed learning packets on Monday and Wednesday, the district will consolidate packet distribution to two sites Friday: Bissonet Plaza Elementary at 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie and at Gretna Middle at 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna. Packets are available for all grade levels, but supply is limited. Families with home internet access are encouraged to use the district's online resources. The printed packets were created for families unable to access the district’s online resources. The first and second round of packets, along with additional resources, can be found at jpschools.org/LearnAtHome.</p>
<p>The 13 Grab &amp; Go sites are open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thel sites will be closed April 10 to observe Good Friday. The locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bissonet Plaza Elementary: 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie</li>
<li>Emmett Gilbert School: 435 S. Jamie Blvd. in Westwego</li>
<li>Fisher: 2529 Jean Lafitte Blvd. in Lafitte</li>
<li>Gretna Middle: 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna</li>
<li>Hazel Park Elementary: 8809 Jefferson Hwy. in River Ridge</li>
<li>Marie Riviere Elementary: 1564 Lake Ave. in Metairie</li>
<li>Marrero Middle: 4100 7th Street in Marrero</li>
<li>Meisler Middle: 3700 Cleary Ave. in Metairie</li>
<li>Riverdale High: 240 Riverdale Drive in Jefferson</li>
<li>Terrytown Elementary: 550 E. Forest Lawn Drive in Terrytown</li>
<li>Truman School: 5417 Ehret Road in Marrero</li>
<li>Woods Elementary: 1037 31st Street in Kenner</li>
<li>Worley Middle: 801 Spartans Drive in Westwego</li>
</ul>
<p>Eighty-two percent of the families in JP Schools are economically disadvantaged. </p>
<p>Three O’Clock Project (TOP) is a nonprofit organization. Their mission is to provide healthy meals and nutrition education for at-risk students after school. </p>
<p>Meals will be provided to all children age 18 and under without charge. Acceptance and participating requirements for the program and all activities are the same for all regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or retaliation for prior civil rights activity in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA and there will be no discrimination in the course of the meal service. Jefferson Parish Schools is an equal opportunity provider.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #9 - 3/30/20: JP Schools Offers Emotional Support Line for Families &amp; Employees</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools recognizes the significant impact that COVID-19 and the subsequent school closures are having on the emotional well being of many of our families and staff. In order to provide emotional support, we created an Emotional Support Line for parents and staff members.</p>
<p>Starting March 31, experienced mental health professionals will be available via telephone to provide emotional support and share any pertinent resources during these difficult times. Parents of Jefferson Parish Schools students and staff members may call (504) 349-7629, Monday – Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or between 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p>If students, staff, or families are in a life-threatening situation, they should call 911.</p>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has served nearly 100,000 meals to children since starting its Grab &amp; Go service March 18. The district has announced changes to the program that will allow it to reach even more families in need. </p>
<p>JP Schools is partnering with the Three O’Clock Project to offer children enough meals for all seven days of the week starting April 1. The partnership will also allow the district to deliver meals to students in areas where traveling to a Grab &amp; Go site is more challenging for families, </p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 1, the district’s 13 Grab &amp; Go sites will change from operating five days a week to being open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Children will begin receiving breakfast and lunch for that day and the following day on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, children will receive enough breakfasts and lunches to last through the weekend.</p>
<p>“We are here for all children and this partnership will allow us to reach even farther into the community to serve more families,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley.  “I’m grateful to our employees and community partners who continue to go the extra mile for our kids. We’re finding creative solutions for trying times.”</p>
<p>To prepare for this shift, the district’s Grab &amp; Go meal sites will be closed on Tuesday, March 31. The Grab &amp; Go sites will operate as they currently do on Monday, March 30, with families receiving lunch for that day and breakfast for the following morning. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #20: - 6/12/20 Latest on JP Schools Reopening Plans for 2020-21</h1>

<p>JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>We’re less than two months away from the start of a new school year. While it’s our intention to begin classes in-person August 6, we’re preparing for a number of scenarios depending on the status of the health pandemic. Regardless of what August 6 looks like, we will be ready to educate kids on day one. That’s our commitment.</p>
<p>Another commitment we’ve made is to keep our families informed throughout this process. We’d like to share with you some of the plans we have in place for reopening schools. It was developed following the most recent CDC Guidance for Reopening Schools. </p>
<p>Any scenario that involves students attending school in-person will include the following safety precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students and staff will be required to wear face coverings</li>
<li>Social distancing protocols established and communicated with all stakeholders</li>
<li>Temperature checks for all students, employees, and visitors</li>
<li>Teachers and staff members ensure students follow all COVID-19 safety measures</li>
<li>Students follow altered routines for lunch, restroom breaks, bus un/loading, and other travel patterns</li>
<li>Bus capacity will be limited when necessary to ensure all students can arrive at school safely, on time, and following CDC guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re preparing for three possible scenarios to open the year: traditional, hybrid/blended, and 100% virtual. The district will be prepared to immediately shift to virtual instruction should school closure become necessary during the school year. Some of the details of our three reopening scenarios include:</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students attend school five days a week using additional safety precautions</li>
<li>Staff report to school daily</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid/Blended Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Student attend school 2-3 days of the week and receive virtual instruction the other days of the week</li>
<li>District will support families to meet their technology needs</li>
<li>Staff report to school daily and provide in-person and virtual instruction and support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students do not report to school and receive instruction 100% virtual</li>
<li>District will support families to meet their technology needs</li>
<li>Staff report to school on predetermined days</li>
<li>Staff provide support and synchronous instruction via Google Meet and asynchronous instruction via Google Classroom</li>
</ul>
<p>These plans only pertain to opening schools. We will continue to provide guidance throughout the summer regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated safety measures</li>
<li>Attendance requirements</li>
<li>Student recovery for unfinished learning</li>
<li>Preparing students and teachers for various learning methods</li>
<li>Social/emotional learning</li>
<li>Staff and student policies and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our students and staff is our top priority. Our school-based plans will be fluid and routinely adjusted to reflect updated national, state, and local guidance. We know our families and employees have many questions about what the new school year will look like. As we get answers, we will share that information. The district will also begin surveying families about their individual needs in the coming weeks. This will help us make better decisions as we move forward. </p>
<p>We are excited to continue working together to ensure we provide students with the education they deserve to succeed in life and make the world a better place. Jefferson Parish Schools is committed to doing whatever it takes to Start Strong in 2020 and ensure a great 20-21 school year!</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #19: - 5/22/20 General Updates for Summer &amp; Next School year</h1>

<p><b>2020-21 SCENARIOS<br/></b>While ideally we are able to start the year face-to-face, we know that there will likely be changes in how we operate schools next year. There are a few different scenarios for how that may look. This could include face-to-face with additional safety guidelines, engaging students with a hybrid of virtual and face-to-face, or having an as-needed virtual learning environment. We will make a final decision on how we will start the year based on the guidance of local, state, and national health officials. If we are able to begin the school year face-to-face, it will be imperative that educators devote portions of their day to practice virtual lessons in the classroom with students. Should the need arise to shift to a virtual model during the school year, the expectation is to do so as seamlessly as possible. </p>
<p>If you’ve not already, one way you can help us plan is by <a href=""https://k12.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e55f3674f3b8aa800c9f127e4&amp;id=43d3f7410c&amp;e=1eb12f5026"">taking this stakeholder survey</a>. We want your feedback to let us know what’s worked and what we can do better heading into 2020-21. Thank you to the over 7,000 stakeholders who have already offered your input.</p>
<p><b>DECREASED REVENUE<br/></b>We must further reduce expenditures due to the significant decline in our revenue from the stalled economy. Approximately 40% of the district’s revenue comes from sales tax. As the economy has stalled, our estimates show that this could result in a revenue decline of at least $12 million for our district. Any expenditure reduction plan will support our two biggest priorities - student learning and the health and safety of our kids. We previously reduced $16 million from our budget in March. </p>
<p><b>SCHOOL START TIMES<br/></b>Changing the start times for some of our schools was included in the <i>2020 Infrastructure and Efficiency Plan</i> passed by our School Board in March. Based on research and parent feedback, we have made changes to school start times. <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/schooltimes"">You can view the new school times here</a> or click one of the following links: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jpp1w1oO91NKfqpuH7O8LxySbV-kaoEI"">East Bank</a> | <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bIsOswIAtJKT_N9JvYoinq-9BPjlWGb9"">West Bank</a>. These will go into effect for the 2020-21 school year. Where possible, we are starting elementary schools earlier and high schools later. We believe this will support working parents of elementary students and lead to stronger outcomes for high school students. This will also help us financially through more efficient use of buses and routes. Based on schedules, schools will adjust before and after care programs and extracurricular activities accordingly. </p>
<p><b>GRAB &amp; GO <br/></b>Our Grab &amp; Go meal program will continue through the summer. The meal locations and times will remain the same. Meals will be available to families at our 13 Grab &amp; Go sites Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays this summer from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Families will be provided enough meals for all seven days of the week. Children will receive breakfast and lunch for that day and the following day on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, children will receive enough breakfasts and lunches to last through the weekend. For more information about this program, visit <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/grabandgo"">jpschools.org/GrabAndGo</a>.</p>
<p><b>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT LINE<br/></b>This is the final week for our academic support line, but our emotional support line will remain available to employees and families through the summer. You can call (504) 349-7629 weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or between 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p><b>EARLY START JEFFERSON &amp; LEAP REMEDIATION<br/></b>As we approach the summer months, we want to offer an additional educational opportunity for our struggling students. Early Start Jefferson will invite students in grades K-5 who are below proficiency in math and/or ELA to participate in a program the two weeks before the start of next school year. The program will offer either an in-person or completely virtual model. We have communicated information about Early Start Jefferson to school leaders and they are identifying students who would benefit from this program. We are also seeking current JP employees to work our Early Start Jefferson program. If interested, please apply via this link:<a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFZmCjmQPR6TInkIMKYY613w3aUxmeXUbskNHg-nY8XoDg7w/viewform""> Early Start JPS Employment Application</a>. </p>
<p>We also will host remediation from June 29-July 10 for any student needing to re-take the high school LEAP test. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8YusAg1-a6Tosryrr5YfDZyvhb1Aw6P8g7nUIXLGKuJbKEg/viewform"">Students can register at this link</a>. </p>
<p><b>SUMMER CAMPS<br/></b>Jefferson Parish Schools will not operate summer camps due to COVID-19. We are partnering with Ed Navigator on their at-home program, Camp Kinda. This is a free summer experience designed to keep kids engaged, asking questions, and having fun. Each weekday from June 1 to September 1, participating families will get 3-4 hours’ worth of daily activities, all connected to a weekly theme and curated by experts with a passion for their topic. <a href=""https://campkinda.org/welcome"">You can learn more at this link</a>. </p>

<p><b>TAG-ALONG TRANSFER REQUEST FORMS <br/></b>Tag-Along Transfer Requests will be available for online submission only beginning May 26. Tag-Along allows for children of principals, assistant principals, guidance counselors, teachers, coaches, other certified school employees, and classified employees regularly assigned to or employed on a full-time basis at a school in grades kindergarten through twelve to attend the school in which they are assigned or a school in the feeder pattern of their assigned school. This information will be available at <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/domain/119"">jpschools.org</a>. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #18 - 4/27/20: JP Schools Announces Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments for All Students</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has announced how it will handle student grades, grade promotion, and graduation decisions with school buildings closed through the end of the academic year. This information is available now at jpschools.org/grades. </p>
<p>“We are being intentionally student-friendly with these policy shifts. The last thing I want to do is punish a child for a situation completely out of their control,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley. “The remainder of our school year will be an opportunity for students to improve their grades for the year while continuing to learn new content.”</p>
<p>As of Monday, April 27, students can complete at-home learning assignments for a grade. These additional assignments are meant to benefit students and can only improve final grades. </p>
<p>“While these assignments are not mandatory nor required, we encourage families to participate in every learning opportunity available to maintain a continuity of learning until our last day of school on May 21,” said Dr. Brumley. “ The more our students engage academically this spring, the more ready they will be for their next grade level.” </p>
<p>Families with questions about their child’s options should email their teacher. Teacher email addresses can be found on each school website. School websites are linked at jpschools.org/schools. The district has also opened a hotline for families who need academic support. The hotline number is 504-349-8999. The call center will be open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The full grading and promotion adjustments can be viewed at jpschools.org/grades.</p>
<p><b>Elementary and Middle School Students</b></p>
<p>Students with internet access should continue accessing and utilizing online resources at jpschools.org/learnathome.  Students without internet access should complete a third round at-home learning packet to receive a 4th quarter grade. Packets will be available April 28 and 30 at all Grab &amp; Go sites.</p>
<p><b>High School Students</b></p>
<p>High school students will be given the opportunity to complete online at-home learning activities to improve their grades. Students who were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits. If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, their final grades will be averages of the previous quarters. </p>
<p>High school seniors may elect to receive either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits. If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing the short Google Form at jpschools.org/grades.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #16 - 4/22/20: JP Schools Announces Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments for High School Students</h1>

<p><strong>Awarding Carnegie Credit and Graduation Guidance for Families</strong></p>
<p>Regulatory course adjustments have been granted due to the current school closures. These adjustments will enable students to complete the school year and graduate without penalty. </p>
<p><strong>ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will students meet credit requirements?</strong></p>
<p>The final grade for the semester will average the 3rd quarter grade with the 4th quarter online learning activities. The online learning activities shall not negatively impact the final grade. The completion of online learning activities will only serve to improve a grade, not lower a grade. </p>
<p><strong>Are the</strong> <strong>4th quarter</strong> <strong>at-home learning assignments mandatory?</strong></p>
<p>These assignments are encouraged but are not mandatory nor required. Students are being given the opportunity to improve their final grades with the at-home activities.  However, students that were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits.</p>
<p>If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, his/her final grades will be averages of the previous quarter(s). </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is currently failing a course?</strong></p>
<p>Students that have not met proficiency (have an F average) must complete the course in PLATO. For information about joining PLATO, families/students should contact their teacher.</p>
<p><strong>How does the waiver of attendance requirements impact students?</strong></p>
<p>Instructional minute and compulsory attendance requirements have been waived for the year.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a dual enrollment course with a college or university?</strong></p>
<p>The following three options have been approved for Dual Enrollment students: </p>
<ul>
<li>Continue the course via distance learning options through the higher education institution and earn credit when the course ends; </li>
<li>Opt for an “In Progress” designation and have until August 31, 2020, to complete the course and earn credit; or </li>
<li>Opt for an “Administrative Withdrawal” and exit the course with no credit and nothing posted to the official college transcript.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can students still take the Advanced Placement tests?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  A new (at home) online test is available to allow students the opportunity to earn college credit and placement. Contact your school counselor for more information or visit the <a href=""https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/exam-dates-and-fees?affiliateId=ap%7Chome&amp;bannerId=cal%7Capc-examdates"">AP website </a>for testing information. </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a ½ credit course?</strong></p>
<p>Students enrolled in a ½ credit course for the 4th quarter must complete the course assignments in PLATO or Google Classroom to be awarded credit.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student completed an at-home learning packet?</strong></p>
<p>The at-home learning packets distributed at our 13 Grab and Go sites will not be graded nor counted towards a 4th quarter grade. These packets are for academic enrichment purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>SENIORS ONLY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will seniors receive a letter grade or can they choose a Pass/Fail option?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Families may elect either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits.</li>
<li>Pass/Fail options are not calculated into the Grade Point Average (i.e., for the purpose of Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS), college athletic eligibility and/or academic admissions/scholarships). </li>
<li>If the Pass/Fail option is chosen, all spring semester courses will be awarded the grade of Pass/Fail. A Pass/Fail acknowledgment form must be requested from the high school.</li>
<li>If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing<a href=""https://forms.gle/EPipELPUokz9WqeB8""> this short Google Form</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do seniors still need to complete the financial aid requirement?</strong></p>
<p>No. The financial aid planning graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors.  Despite this requirement being waived, families are encouraged to apply online by visiting <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"">the FAFSA website</a>.  </p>
<p>In addition to state financial aid programs (e.g. TOPS and LA Go Grant), there are Federal Student Aid programs that require FAFSA completion, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pell Grant</li>
<li>Supplemental Education Opportunity Program/SEOG</li>
<li>Federal Work Study</li>
<li>Federal Direct Loans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a senior needs a LEAP 2025 high school assessment score to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The spring LEAP 2025 assessment window has been cancelled, and the requirement has been waived for currently enrolled graduating seniors. The senior waivers apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any current student, enrolled as of February 1, that would be classified as a senior at any time during the current school year with the necessary credits to graduate</li>
<li>Graduating seniors eligible under ACT 833</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a TOPS Tech Diploma senior needs an IBC credential to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The IBC terminal graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors. Graduating seniors will be eligible to graduate with a TOPS Tech Diploma without earning the IBC credential. </p>
<p><strong>Is there an exception for the TOPS Core GPA due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>No. TOPS requires a minimum TOPS Core GPA of 2.50.  This requirement still applies even if a student chooses to receive Pass/Fail grades from the high school.  Parents should take this into account and make careful consideration before selecting this option.</p>
<p><strong>If seniors have not had the opportunity to take the ACT, will this be waived so these students can graduate?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Seniors are not required to test as a condition of graduation. However, ACT exam options are available in June 2020 if students want to take the exam to qualify for TOPS eligibility.  </p>
<p><strong>What if a senior cannot meet the 25-hour requirement to earn a Community Service Seal due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>The 25-hour requirement has been waived for 2019-2020 seniors.  If students have met the requirements for their freshmen sophomore, and junior years, they may be awarded the diploma seal.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #15 - 4/16/20: Jefferson Parish Schools Moves Class of 2020 Graduations to July</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools is moving its high school graduations to July in an effort to preserve in-person commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2020. The district announced that graduations for 14 of its 15 senior classes will now take place in July. </p>
<p>“Senior year is one of the most memorable times of our kids’ lives, and the pinnacle of this time is the commencement ceremony,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley. “We’re doing everything in our power to make this moment special for the Class of 2020. Our seniors deserve a traditional graduation and I want to do all we can to make that possible.“ </p>
<p>District leaders made the switch with the hope it will be safe to gather for an appropriate celebration by July. Commencement ceremonies for all JP Schools graduating classes except Grand Isle School, JCFA Charter, and Kenner Discovery Charter High will take place July 6-9 at the Pontchartrain Center. Should it not be safe to hold in-person commencement ceremonies by July, the schools will instead hold virtual graduations in mid-July. Grand Isle School will hold its ceremony in the school’s gymnasium July 10. Kenner Discovery Charter High will be releasing information soon about their graduation plans.  JCFA Charter will hold its graduation July 14 at La Maison Creole in Harvey.</p>
<p>The ceremonies will be abbreviated and include additional safety measures. Speeches and performances will be limited and invitations will be reduced. The district will record each graduation and make those videos available online. Schools will communicate information about diploma pick-up and commencement ceremonies to families. The district is announcing this change now to give families as much notice as possible.</p>
<p>JP Schools commencement ceremonies were scheduled to start May 9 and conclude May 17. There are over 2,600 high school seniors in Jefferson Parish Schools. Fifteen schools in the district have a 2020 graduating class: Bonnabel High, East Jefferson High, Fisher Middle-High, Grace King High, Grand Isle School, Haynes Academy, Helen Cox High, Higgins High, JCFA Charter, John Ehret High, Kenner Discovery Charter High, Patrick F. Taylor Academy, Thomas Jefferson Academy, and West Jefferson High.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #14 - 4/15/20: All Louisiana School Buildings Will Remain Closed Through the Remainder of the 2019-20 School Year</h1>

<p>Dear JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Today, Governor Edwards announced that all Louisiana school buildings will remain closed through the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. This is difficult news to hear, but we fully support the Governor’s decision. The safety of our students and employees is our top responsibility. Our state has made great progress towards flattening the curve, and we all must do everything in our power to ensure the trend continues.</p>
<p>This announcement means our buildings remain closed. As we have learned over the past month, “school” is much more than a building. School will continue until students’ last day on May 21. Just like it has throughout the closure, learning will continue in Jefferson Parish Schools. Our at-home learning resources are available to students in multiple forms and delivery methods.</p>
<p>Families with internet access should visit <a href=""http://jpschools.org/LearnAtHome"">jpschools.org/LearnAtHome</a>. That’s our digital hub for a diverse offering of lessons, daily schedules, as well as self-guided, student-specific online programs. We also encourage families to email their teachers, as many educators have started offering online lessons through Google Classroom. Since schools closed in mid-March, we have trained over 2,000 educators (and counting) on Google Classroom. </p>
<p>For our families without the technology to access online resources, we will distribute a final round of learning packets at our Grab &amp; Go sites April 28 and 30 that will last through the end of the school year. We will also announce information this week about a laptop loaner program for the final five weeks of school. </p>
<p>Our Grab &amp; Go sites will provide meals on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule through the end of the school year. We will also maintain operation of our academic and emotional support call centers. </p>
<p>I know you have questions about what this means for your child. As a parent of school-age children, I share many of your same concerns. Louisiana is not the first state to make this difficult decision, and it won’t be the last. As we began seeing states make this call and the number of coronavirus cases rise in our region, we started planning for this possibility. Continue to visit <a href=""http://jpschools.org/coronavirus"">jpschools.org/coronavirus</a> for the most recent district updates, resources, and a running list of frequently asked questions. Teachers and principals will also be available via email for school specific questions.</p>
<p>Your school will be your first line of communication. We all learned about the Governor’s decision today during his public announcement. This includes our principals, teachers, and support staff. They will be in contact with families about what this means for their child. Please be patient as our educators learn and prepare information to share. If you haven’t done so before, make a habit of regularly visiting your school’s website. Those web addresses can be found at <a href=""http://jpschools.org/schools"">jpschools.org/schools</a>.</p>
<p>I wish we had answers to all your questions right now, but we don’t. We have done our best to prepare for this situation while simultaneously leading the district through day-to-day realities of this unprecedented public health crisis. There are many moving parts and pieces. We want to make sure they all fit and work smoothly together. Please continue to check our website, free Jefferson Parish School mobile app, and our social media pages for the latest updates. As we learn more information, we will share it with you. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #13 - 4/9/20: LHSAA Announces Cancellation of Remaining Winter &amp; Spring Sports</h1>

<p>The Louisiana High School Athletic Association has made the decision to cancel all remaining winter and spring sports for the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>""This decision was not in haste and was discussed with tremendous concern for those senior athletes being affected,"" said LHSAA Executive Director Eddie Bonine. ""We realize and concur with the argument about retuning to normalcy and allowing seniors to have their moment, just like we did for boys' basketball championships, unfortunately, circumstances today are tremendously different than circumstances were that week in March. We understand the hardships and disappointments everyone, especially the class of 2020, is enduring due to the closure of schools facilities, but our unwavering focus must now remain on doing our part by continuing to follow any and all mitigation measures set forth by our Governor.""</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #12 - 4/6/20: Jefferson Parish Schools Recognizing Spring Break April 10-14</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools will recognize its originally scheduled Spring Break April 10-14. While all schools and buildings are already closed until at least April 30 due to the Governor's proclamation, all JP Schools employees will be off for Spring Break. Employees have been working remotely where possible. </p>
<p>The district will not operate Grab &amp; Go meal sites or its academic and emotional support call centers during Spring Break. Teachers and administrators will also not be available to families via email during the break. While families will still have access to the district's optional at-home learning resources, the district encourages students and families to also take a break from at-home learning.</p>
<p>The district will resume its regular closure activities and schedule April 15. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #11 - 4/2/20: Governor Edwards Extends School Closures Until At Least April 30</h1>

<p>Dear JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Today, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that he is extending school closures in the state until at least April 30. This coincides with President Trump’s announcement this past weekend to extend the national social distancing guidelines until April 30.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of a national health crisis, and I fully support the Governor’s decision to keep kids home. While we were prepared for schools to reopen April 15, we’ve also planned for this extension. We remain committed to providing students, families, and the community with as much support as possible during this unprecedented time.</p>
<p>We will continue to operate our Grab &amp; Go meal program and provide families with optional at-home learning resources.</p>
<p>We’ll also continue to operate our Emotional Support Line. Experienced mental health professionals are available via telephone to provide emotional support and share any pertinent resources during these difficult times. Parents of JP Schools students and staff members may call (504) 349-7629 weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p>To our high school seniors, know that you are still the Class of 2020, and I look forward to signing each and every one of your diplomas. We are working on a process to ensure you have the opportunity to graduate this spring.</p>
<p>We are working to find creative solutions during these trying times. Nothing will match the support we provide children and families when our doors are open. We know our families need us now more than ever, and we are doing everything we can to step into the gap for them.</p>
<p>I know there will be many questions and growing pains. You can find frequently asked questions and additional information at <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/coronavirus"">jpschools.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you as we continue to partner together in educating our students.</p>
<p><br/>Dr. Brumley<br/>Superintendent<br/>Jefferson Parish Schools</p>

<p>Queridos Colegas,</p>
<p>Hoy, el gobernador John Bel Edwards anuncio que extenderá el cierre de escuelas en el estado hasta al menos el 30 de abril. Esto coincide con el anuncio del Presidente Trump el pasado fin de semana de extender las guías nacionales de distanciamiento social hasta el 30 de abril.</p>
<p>Estamos en medio de una crisis nacional de salud, y apoyo totalmente la decisión del gobernador de mantener a los niños en casa. Si bien estábamos preparados para que las escuelas reabrieran el 15 de abril, también hemos planeado para esta extensión. Seguimos comprometidos a proporcionas a los estudiantes, las familias y la comunidad el mayor apoyo posible durante este tiempo sin precedente.</p>
<p>Continuaremos operando nuestro programa de comidas Grab &amp; Go y brindaremos a las familias recursos de aprendizaje en el hogar.</p>
<p>También continuaremos operando nuestra Línea de Apoyo Emocional. Profesionales con experiencia en salud mental están disponibles por teléfono para brindar apoyo emocional y compartir los recursos pertinentes durante estos tiempos difíciles. Los padres de los estudiantes y miembros del personal de las escuelas de JP pueden llamar al (504) 349-7629 de lunes a viernes de 10 a.m. a 1 p.m. o de 4 p.m. a 6 p.m. para hablar con uno de nuestros profesionales capacitados en salud mental.</p>
<p>Para nuestros estudiantes de último año de secundaria, sepan que todavía son de la clase 2020, y espero firmar todos y cada uno de sus diplomas. Estamos trabajando en un proceso para garantizar que tengan la oportunidad de graduarse esta primavera.</p>
<p>Estamos trabajando para encontrar soluciones creativas durante estos tiempos difíciles. Nada igualará el apoyo que brindamos a los niños y las familias cuando nuestras puertas estén abiertas. Sabemos que nuestras familias nos necesitan ahora más que nunca, y estamos haciendo todo lo posible para abrirnos paso por ellos.</p>
<p>Sé que habrá muchas preguntas y dolores de crecimiento. Puede encontrar preguntas frecuentes e información adicional en jpschools.org/coronavirus.</p>
<p>Gracias por todos ustedes mientras continuamos colaborando juntos en la educación de nuestros estudiantes.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #10 - 4/2/20: JP Schools Announces Friday Changes to Meals and Packet Distribution</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has announced two changes to the support it is providing families. While families will still be served meals for every day of the week at the district’s 13 Grab &amp; Go sites, weekend meals will not be provided until additional approval is granted by the USDA. The district is also consolidating its learning packet distribution to two sites for Friday: Bissonet Plaza Elementary and Gretna Middle.</p>
<p>JP Schools began a partnership with the Three O’Clock Project April 1 on its Grab &amp; Go meals program. The shift allows the district to serve the same amount of meals to students while only operating the sites three days a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). JP Schools and the Three O-Clock Project were originally given approval to serve weekend meals on Fridays. The USDA then notified the state this week that it was still weighing funding approval for the weekend meals. Families will continue to receive breakfasts and lunches for that day and the next on Monday and Wednesday, as well as lunch and breakfast on Friday. Jefferson Parish Schools has served over 125,000 meals to children since starting its Grab &amp; Go service March 18. </p>
<p>After passing out 43,000 printed learning packets on Monday and Wednesday, the district will consolidate packet distribution to two sites Friday: Bissonet Plaza Elementary at 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie and at Gretna Middle at 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna. Packets are available for all grade levels, but supply is limited. Families with home internet access are encouraged to use the district's online resources. The printed packets were created for families unable to access the district’s online resources. The first and second round of packets, along with additional resources, can be found at jpschools.org/LearnAtHome.</p>
<p>The 13 Grab &amp; Go sites are open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thel sites will be closed April 10 to observe Good Friday. The locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bissonet Plaza Elementary: 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie</li>
<li>Emmett Gilbert School: 435 S. Jamie Blvd. in Westwego</li>
<li>Fisher: 2529 Jean Lafitte Blvd. in Lafitte</li>
<li>Gretna Middle: 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna</li>
<li>Hazel Park Elementary: 8809 Jefferson Hwy. in River Ridge</li>
<li>Marie Riviere Elementary: 1564 Lake Ave. in Metairie</li>

<li>Woods Elementary: 1037 31st Street in Kenner</li>
<li>Worley Middle: 801 Spartans Drive in Westwego</li>
</ul>
<p>Eighty-two percent of the families in JP Schools are economically disadvantaged. </p>
<p>Three O’Clock Project (TOP) is a nonprofit organization. Their mission is to provide healthy meals and nutrition education for at-risk students after school. </p>
<p>Meals will be provided to all children age 18 and under without charge. Acceptance and participating requirements for the program and all activities are the same for all regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or retaliation for prior civil rights activity in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA and there will be no discrimination in the course of the meal service. Jefferson Parish Schools is an equal opportunity provider.</p>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools recognizes the significant impact that COVID-19 and the subsequent school closures are having on the emotional well being of many of our families and staff. In order to provide emotional support, we created an Emotional Support Line for parents and staff members.</p>
<p>Starting March 31, experienced mental health professionals will be available via telephone to provide emotional support and share any pertinent resources during these difficult times. Parents of Jefferson Parish Schools students and staff members may call (504) 349-7629, Monday – Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or between 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #7 - 3/27/20: JP Schools &amp; Three O’Clock Project Partnership Provides Meals for More Children</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has served nearly 100,000 meals to children since starting its Grab &amp; Go service March 18. The district has announced changes to the program that will allow it to reach even more families in need. </p>
<p>JP Schools is partnering with the Three O’Clock Project to offer children enough meals for all seven days of the week starting April 1. The partnership will also allow the district to deliver meals to students in areas where traveling to a Grab &amp; Go site is more challenging for families, </p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 1, the district’s 13 Grab &amp; Go sites will change from operating five days a week to being open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Children will begin receiving breakfast and lunch for that day and the following day on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, children will receive enough breakfasts and lunches to last through the weekend.</p>
<p>“We are here for all children and this partnership will allow us to reach even farther into the community to serve more families,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley.  “I’m grateful to our employees and community partners who continue to go the extra mile for our kids. We’re finding creative solutions for trying times.”</p>
<p>To prepare for this shift, the district’s Grab &amp; Go meal sites will be closed on Tuesday, March 31. The Grab &amp; Go sites will operate as they currently do on Monday, March 30, with families receiving lunch for that day and breakfast for the following morning. </p>
<p>The 13 Grab &amp; Go times and locations will remain the same. The sites are open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bissonet Plaza Elementary: 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie</li>
<li>Emmett Gilbert School: 435 S. Jamie Blvd. in Westwego</li>
<li>Fisher: 2529 Jean Lafitte Blvd. in Lafitte</li>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #6 - 3/16/20: JP Schools Offering Grab &amp; Go Meals, Optional At-Home Learning Resources, Call Center for Families During School Closures</h1>

<p>Students are out of school until at least April 14, but Jefferson Parish Schools will offer student meals and optional at-home learning resources to families. The at-home learning resources will be available two ways: online at jpschools.org and in printed packets families can pick up beginning this Wednesday, March 18. That’s the day the district will begin providing grab and go meals for children. JP Schools educators will also operate a hotline for families who need academic support.</p>
<p>“Nothing we offer will fully replace the supports our kids receive when our doors are open,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley.  “We are stepping up to make this uncertain time a little easier for families.”</p>
<p>Meals will be provided weekdays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., beginning March 18. Families can pick up the first round of printed learning packets in the grab and go meal line March 18-20. New packets will be available March 30 through April 2.</p>
<p>Families can go to any of the 13 locations to pick up a free Grab and Go meal and at-home learning packet, even if the site is not their home school.</p>
<p>The grab and go locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bissonet Plaza Elementary: 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie</li>
<li>Emmett Gilbert School: 435 S. Jamie Blvd. in Westwego</li>
<li>Fisher: 2529 Jean Lafitte Blvd. in Lafitte</li>
<li>Gretna Middle: 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna</li>
<li>Hazel Park Elementary: 8809 Jefferson Hwy. in River Ridge</li>
<li>Marie Riviere Elementary: 1564 Lake Ave. in Metairie</li>
<li>Marrero Middle: 4100 7th Street in Marrero</li>
<li>Meisler Middle: 3700 Cleary Ave. in Metairie</li>
<li>Riverdale High: 240 Riverdale Drive in Jefferson</li>
<li>Terrytown Elementary: 550 E. Forest Lawn Drive in Terrytown</li>
<li>Truman School: 5417 Ehret Road in Marrero</li>
<li>Woods Elementary: 1037 31st Street in Kenner</li>
<li>Worley Middle: 801 Spartans Drive in Westwego</li>
</ul>
<p>Meals will be offered to any child age 18 and under regardless of whether they are a Jefferson Parish Schools student. Printed learning packets will be available for students in grades pre-K to 8th. Children must be present with an adult to receive a meal and learning packet. Meals will include lunch for that day and breakfast for the following morning. The printed learning packets are intended for families who do not have internet access to the resources available on the district website. High school students are encouraged to use the digital coursework linked at jpschools.org. </p>
<p>The grab and go service will include pick-up lines outside the school for families t","o drive through or walk up. In order to avoid creating a large crowd, it is important that families immediately leave campus after receiving their meal and packet. </p>
<p>We encourage our families to reach out to their teachers with any academic questions. Teacher email addresses are available on individual school websites. For a school website directory, visit jpschools.org/schools. The district will open a hotline March 18 for families who need academic support. The hotline number is 504-349-8999. The call center will be open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. beginning March 18. The hotline is available for families who have questions about either the online learning resources or printed learning packets.</p>
<p>In response to the Governor’s emergency proclamation, all Jefferson Parish Schools are closed Monday, March 16 through at least April 14. JP Schools is on spring break April 10-14. The district has made digital at-home learning resources available to families at jpschools.org. </p>
<p>Eighty-two percent of the families in JP Schools are economically disadvantaged. JP Schools also estimates that around 50% of the families it serves lack the internet service or home technology to receive the digital at-home learning resources available to students.</p>
<p>Meals will be provided to all children age 18 and under without charge. Acceptance and participating requirements for the program and all activities are the same for all regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or retaliation for prior civil rights activity in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA and there will be no discrimination in the course of the meal service.

Posted by: <i></i>
 

<p>Jefferson Parish is offering at-home learning options in two different formats: online and print. These resources are meant to provide optional opportunities for student learning while students are absent from school. The district will not require online distance learning since we can not ensure that all students will have equal access to learning. We are the largest district in our state with a diverse student population, and many of our students do not have regular access to technology or the internet. </p>
<p>We encourage our students and families to utilize these resources. Our teachers will be responsive and available via email should families have questions. Please know this will not take the place of regular classroom instruction. It’s meant to supplement student learning at home.</p>

",,1,"<a></a>






<h1>Grading and Promotion Adjustments</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Adjustments to previously outlined grading and promotion policies have been made due to the current school closures. Families with questions about their child’s options should email their teacher. Teacher email addresses can be found on each school website. School websites are linked at <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/schools"">jpschools.org/schools</a>.</p>



</li>
</ul>






























<h1>Elementary &amp; Middle (PK-8 Grade) Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p><strong>Will my PK-8 student be promoted to the next grade next year?</strong></p>
<p>If a student was on track to move onto the next grade before these closures, there is no reason why that shouldn’t still be the case now. We’ve encouraged our educators to contact every family to inform them about their child’s status and options moving forward. If you have questions about your child, please reach out to your child’s teacher. </p>
<p><strong>Are the</strong> <strong>4th quarter</strong> <strong>at-home learning assignments mandatory?</strong></p>
<p>While these assignments are not mandatory nor required, we encourage families to participate in every learning opportunity available.  The more our students engage academically this spring, the more ready they will be for their next grade level. </p>
<p>As of Monday, April 27, students will have the opportunity to complete at-home learning assignments for a grade. These additional assignments can only improve final grades and benefit students. Students are being given the opportunity to improve their final grades with the at-home activities.  </p>
<p><strong>What if my student doesn’t complete any 4th quarter at-home learning assignments?</strong></p>
<p>If students do not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, their final grades will be averaged from the first three quarters.  Students will NOT be penalized if they don’t complete at-home learning assignments.  </p>
<p><strong>How does my student complete at-home learning assignments?</strong></p>
<p>If students have online access, teachers will assign and grade at least three online assignments to determine the 4th quarter grade. Students should complete the three 4th quarter on-grade level online assignments by May 15 to receive a 4th quarter grade.</p>
<p>If students don’t have online access, they should complete a third round at-home learning packet by May 15 to receive a 4th quarter grade. Packets will be available April 28th and 30th at all Grab and Go sites. They are also available for at-home printing at <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/learnathome"">jpschools.org/LearnAtHome</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Can my student do both online learning AND the packet?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Students can complete both online assignments and the third round learning packet for a 4th quarter grade.</p>
<p><strong>How do I turn in my student’s third round at-home learning packet?</strong></p>
<p>Drop off the completed, labeled packet at your home school on May 15. Only the third round at-home learning packet will be eligible for a grade. The first and second round of packets will not be graded.</p>
<p><strong>What if my student is failing? </strong></p>
<p>Schools will convene virtual meetings to examine student performance on classroom assignments, course grades, and district benchmark assessments for those students who were in danger of failing. Students will only be retained if a preponderance of evidence during the first three quarters indicate the student should be retained. Students in middle school should not be automatically retained due to an F in the 3rd nine weeks. Schools will adhere to promotion and retention guidelines and timelines outlined in the <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/125/JPS%20PPP%2019-20.pdf"">JP Pupil Progression Plan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What if my 8th grade student is enrolled in a Carnegie Course?</strong></p>
<p>A student enrolled in a Carnegie course must pass the course in order to receive Carnegie credit. If a student enrolled in a Carnegie course is failing (a combined average below a 1.0 from quarters 1,2, and 3), the student must complete and pass the online learning activities via PLATO or Google Classroom (minimum of 3 lessons/activities) to allow the student the opportunity to improve their grade.</p>
<p><strong>How does the waiver of attendance requirements impact students?</strong></p>
<p>Instructional minutes and compulsory attendance requirements have been waived for the year.</p>



</li>
</ul>






























<h1>High School Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p><strong>Awarding Carnegie Credit and Graduation Guidance for Families</strong></p>
<p>Regulatory course adjustments have been granted due to the current school closures. These adjustments will enable students to complete the school year and graduate without penalty. </p>
<p><strong>ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will students meet credit requirements?</strong></p>
<p>The final grade for the semester will average the 3rd quarter grade with the 4th quarter online learning activities. The online learning activities shall not negatively impact the final grade. The completion of online learning activities will only serve to improve a grade, not lower a grade. </p>
<p><strong>Are the</strong> <strong>4th quarter</strong> <strong>at-home learning assignments mandatory?</strong></p>
<p>These assignments are encouraged but are not mandatory nor required. Students are being given the opportunity to improve their final grades with the at-home activities.  However, students that were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits.</p>
<p>If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, his/her final grades will be averages of the previous quarter(s). </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is currently failing a course?</strong></p>
<p>Students that have not met proficiency (have an F average) must complete the course in Edmentum (PLATO). For information about joining PLATO, families/students should contact their teacher.</p>
<p><strong>How does the waiver of attendance requirements impact students?</strong></p>
<p>Instructional minute and compulsory attendance requirements have been waived for the year.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a dual enrollment course with a college or university?</strong></p>
<p>The following three options have been approved for Dual Enrollment students: </p>
<ul>
<li>Continue the course via distance learning options through the higher education institution and earn credit when the course ends; </li>
<li>Opt for an “In Progress” designation and have until August 31, 2020, to complete the course and earn credit; or </li>
<li>Opt for an “Administrative Withdrawal” and exit the course with no credit and nothing posted to the official college transcript.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can students still take the Advanced Placement tests?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  A new (at home) online test is available to allow students the opportunity to earn college credit and placement. Contact your school counselor for more information or visit the <a href=""https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/exam-dates-and-fees?affiliateId=ap%7Chome&amp;bannerId=cal%7Capc-examdates"">AP website </a>for testing information. </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a ½ credit course?</strong></p>
<p>Students enrolled in a ½ credit course for the 4th quarter must complete the course assignments in Edmentum (PLATO) or Google Classroom to be awarded credit.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student completed an at-home learning packet?</strong></p>
<p>The at-home learning packets distributed at our 13 Grab and Go sites will not be graded nor counted towards a 4th quarter grade. These packets are for academic enrichment purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>SENIORS ONLY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will seniors receive a letter grade or can they choose a Pass/Fail option?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Families may elect either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits.</li>
<li>Pass/Fail options are not calculated into the Grade Point Average (i.e., for the purpose of Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS), college athletic eligibility and/or academic admissions/scholarships). </li>
<li>If the Pass/Fail option is chosen, all spring semester courses will be awarded the grade of Pass/Fail. A Pass/Fail acknowledgment form must be requested from the high school.</li>
<li>If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing<a href=""https://forms.gle/EPipELPUokz9WqeB8""> this short Google Form</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do seniors still need to complete the financial aid requirement?</strong></p>
<p>No. The financial aid planning graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors.  Despite this requirement being waived, families are encouraged to apply online by visiting <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"">the FAFSA website</a>.  </p>
<p>In addition to state financial aid programs (e.g. TOPS and LA Go Grant), there are Federal Student Aid programs that require FAFSA completion, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pell Grant</li>
<li>Supplemental Education Opportunity Program/SEOG</li>
<li>Federal Work Study</li>
<li>Federal Direct Loans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a senior needs a LEAP 2025 high school assessment score to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The spring LEAP 2025 assessment window has been cancelled, and the requirement has been waived for currently enrolled graduating seniors. The senior waivers apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any current student, enrolled as of February 1, that would be classified as a senior at any time during the current school year with the necessary credits to graduate</li>
<li>Graduating seniors eligible under ACT 833</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a TOPS Tech Diploma senior needs an IBC credential to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The IBC terminal graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors. Graduating seniors will be eligible to graduate with a TOPS Tech Diploma without earning the IBC credential. </p>
<p><strong>Is there an exception for the TOPS Core GPA due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>No. TOPS requires a minimum TOPS Core GPA of 2.50.  This requirement still applies even if a student chooses to receive Pass/Fail grades from the high school.  Parents should take this into account and make careful consideration before selecting this option.</p>
<p><strong>If seniors have not had the opportunity to take the ACT, will this be waived so these students can graduate?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Seniors are not required to test as a condition of graduation. However, ACT exam options are available in June 2020 if students want to take the exam to qualify for TOPS eligibility.  </p>
<p><strong>What if a senior cannot meet the 25-hour requirement to earn a Community Service Seal due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>The 25-hour requirement has been waived for 2019-2020 seniors.  If students have met the requirements for their freshmen sophomore, and junior years, they may be awarded the diploma seal.</p>

Of the approximately 90,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide, less than 1% of cases are in the U.S. (as of 3/2/20). </p>
<p>Health officials have shared that the best ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus are the same preventions recommended for the flu and common cold. <strong>As we are still in cold and flu season, we advise you and your student(s) to take these everyday preventive actions that are always recommended to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stay home and seek appropriate medical attention when you are sick (fever, dry cough, body aches, etc…).</li>
<li>Avoid contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. The constant rubbing action helps soap break down the grease and dirt that carry most germs. This way, your hands don’t just smell fresh, but you’ll also reduce the germ count on your hands by up to 99%.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid sharing your food, dishes, utensils, and other personal hygiene items.</li>
<li>Cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue and place immediately in the trash.</li>
<li>Avoid shaking hands.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In addition to encouraging employees and families to follow the above preventative actions, we are taking the following additional steps to minimize the chance of an outbreak at one of our schools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing sanitation efforts in our schools and buildings, including restrooms, cafeterias, classrooms, etc. </li>
<li>Requiring all employees to complete online training for common illness prevention.</li>
<li>Holding informational webinars for principals and school nurses.</li>
<li>Reporting to a school principal if a current student or staff member has traveled to a country on the CDC’s <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html"">risk assessed list.</a> Out of an abundance of caution, we request that these students and staff wait for the 14-day incubation period (beginning the day of return to the U.S.) to expire before returning to school or work.</li>
<li>Asking new families who register whether the student has traveled internationally within the last two weeks. Out of an abundance of caution, we request that any students who’ve traveled to a country on the CDC’s <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html"">risk assessed list</a> wait for the 14-day incubation period (beginning the day of return to the U.S.) to expire before enrolling in school.</li>
<li>Monitoring absences daily.</li>
<li>Permitting already scheduled out-of-state trips, but until further notice, limiting new out-of-state travel for student field trips, competitions, etc.</li>
<li>No longer incentivizing perfect attendance for students and staff. If students or staff are sick, they should remain at home to avoid possible infection of others.</li>
<li>Limiting large scale non-essential assemblies. Out of an abundance of caution and until further notice, we are recommending limiting assemblies during the school day. </li>
<li>Intentionally and persistently combating stigma. As new information emerges, it’s important we remember that the risk of COVID-19 is not at all connected to race, ethnicity, or nationality. </li>
</ul>
<p>As this is an ongoing situation, the CDC updates its online resources daily. These can be found at <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor the situation and update you if we have more information.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #20: - 6/12/20 Latest on JP Schools Reopening Plans for 2020-21</h1>

<p>JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>We’re less than two months away from the start of a new school year. While it’s our intention to begin classes in-person August 6, we’re preparing for a number of scenarios depending on the status of the health pandemic. Regardless of what August 6 looks like, we will be ready to educate kids on day one. That’s our commitment.</p>
<p>Another commitment we’ve made is to keep our families informed throughout this process. We’d like to share with you some of the plans we have in place for reopening schools. It was developed following the most recent CDC Guidance for Reopening Schools. </p>
<p>Any scenario that involves students attending school in-person will include the following safety precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students and staff will be required to wear face coverings</li>
<li>Social distancing protocols established and communicated with all stakeholders</li>
<li>Temperature checks for all students, employees, and visitors</li>
<li>Teachers and staff members ensure students follow all COVID-19 safety measures</li>
<li>Students follow altered routines for lunch, restroom breaks, bus un/loading, and other travel patterns</li>
<li>Bus capacity will be limited when necessary to ensure all students can arrive at school safely, on time, and following CDC guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re preparing for three possible scenarios to open the year: traditional, hybrid/blended, and 100% virtual. The district will be prepared to immediately shift to virtual instruction should school closure become necessary during the school year. Some of the details of our three reopening scenarios include:</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students attend school five days a week using additional safety precautions</li>
<li>Staff report to school daily</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid/Blended Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Student attend school 2-3 days of the week and receive virtual instruction the other days of the week</li>
<li>District will support families to meet their technology needs</li>
<li>Staff report to school daily and provide in-person and virtual instruction and support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students do not report to school and receive instruction 100% virtual</li>
<li>District will support families to meet their technology needs</li>
<li>Staff report to school on predetermined days</li>
<li>Staff provide support and synchronous instruction via Google Meet and asynchronous instruction via Google Classroom</li>
</ul>
<p>These plans only pertain to opening schools. We will continue to provide guidance throughout the summer regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated safety measures</li>
<li>Attendance requirements</li>
<li>Student recovery for unfinished learning</li>
<li>Preparing students and teachers for various learning methods</li>
<li>Social/emotional learning</li>
<li>Staff and student policies and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our students and staff is our top priority. Our school-based plans will be fluid and routinely adjusted to reflect updated national, state, and local guidance. We know our families and employees have many questions about what the new school year will look like. As we get answers, we will share that information. The district will also begin surveying families about their individual needs in the coming weeks. This will help us make better decisions as we move forward. </p>
<p>We are excited to continue working together to ensure we provide students with the education they deserve to succeed in life and make the world a better place. Jefferson Parish Schools is committed to doing whatever it takes to Start Strong in 2020 and ensure a great 20-21 school year!</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #19: - 5/22/20 General Updates for Summer &amp; Next School year</h1>

<p><b>2020-21 SCENARIOS<br/></b>While ideally we are able to start the year face-to-face, we know that there will likely be changes in how we operate schools next year. There are a few different scenarios for how that may look. This could include face-to-face with additional safety guidelines, engaging students with a hybrid of virtual and face-to-face, or having an as-needed virtual learning environment. We will make a final decision on how we will start the year based on the guidance of local, state, and national health officials. If we are able to begin the school year face-to-face, it will be imperative that educators devote portions of their day to practice virtual lessons in the classroom with students. Should the need arise to shift to a virtual model during the school year, the expectation is to do so as seamlessly as possible. </p>
<p>If you’ve not already, one way you can help us plan is by <a href=""https://k12.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e55f3674f3b8aa800c9f127e4&amp;id=43d3f7410c&amp;e=1eb12f5026"">taking this stakeholder survey</a>. We want your feedback to let us know what’s worked and what we can do better heading into 2020-21. Thank you to the over 7,000 stakeholders who have already offered your input.</p>
<p><b>DECREASED REVENUE<br/></b>We must further reduce expenditures due to the significant decline in our revenue from the stalled economy. Approximately 40% of the district’s revenue comes from sales tax. As the economy has stalled, our estimates show that this could result in a revenue decline of at least $12 million for our district. Any expenditure reduction plan will support our two biggest priorities - student learning and the health and safety of our kids. We previously reduced $16 million from our budget in March. </p>
<p><b>SCHOOL START TIMES<br/></b>Changing the start times for some of our schools was included in the <i>2020 Infrastructure and Efficiency Plan</i> passed by our School Board in March. Based on research and parent feedback, we have made changes to school start times. <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/schooltimes"">You can view the new school times here</a> or click one of the following links: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jpp1w1oO91NKfqpuH7O8LxySbV-kaoEI"">East Bank</a> | <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bIsOswIAtJKT_N9JvYoinq-9BPjlWGb9"">West Bank</a>. These will go into effect for the 2020-21 school year. Where possible, we are starting elementary schools earlier and high schools later. We believe this will support working parents of elementary students and lead to stronger outcomes for high school students. This will also help us financially through more efficient use of buses and routes. Based on schedules, schools will adjust before and after care programs and extracurricular activities accordingly. </p>
<p><b>GRAB &amp; GO <br/></b>Our Grab &amp; Go meal program will continue through the summer. The meal locations and times will remain the same. Meals will be available to families at our 13 Grab &amp; Go sites Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays this summer from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Families will be provided enough meals for all seven days of the week. Children will receive breakfast and lunch for that day and the following day on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, children will receive enough breakfasts and lunches to last through the weekend. For more information about this program, visit <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/grabandgo"">jpschools.org/GrabAndGo</a>.</p>
<p><b>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT LINE<br/></b>This is the final week for our academic support line, but our emotional support line will remain available to employees and families through the summer. You can call (504) 349-7629 weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or between 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p><b>EARLY START JEFFERSON &amp; LEAP REMEDIATION<br/></b>As we approach the summer months, we want to offer an additional educational opportunity for our struggling students. Early Start Jefferson will invite students in grades K-5 who are below proficiency in math and/or ELA to participate in a program the two weeks before the start of next school year. The program will offer either an in-person or completely virtual model. We have communicated information about Early Start Jefferson to school leaders and they are identifying students who would benefit from this program. We are also seeking current JP employees to work our Early Start Jefferson program. If interested, please apply via this link:<a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFZmCjmQPR6TInkIMKYY613w3aUxmeXUbskNHg-nY8XoDg7w/viewform""> Early Start JPS Employment Application</a>. </p>
<p>We also will host remediation from June 29-July 10 for any student needing to re-take the high school LEAP test. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8YusAg1-a6Tosryrr5YfDZyvhb1Aw6P8g7nUIXLGKuJbKEg/viewform"">Students can register at this link</a>. </p>
<p><b>SUMMER CAMPS<br/></b>Jefferson Parish Schools will not operate summer camps due to COVID-19. We are partnering with Ed Navigator on their at-home program, Camp Kinda. This is a free summer experience designed to keep kids engaged, asking questions, and having fun. Each weekday from June 1 to September 1, participating families will get 3-4 hours’ worth of daily activities, all connected to a weekly theme and curated by experts with a passion for their topic. <a href=""https://campkinda.org/welcome"">You can learn more at this link</a>. </p>

<p><b>TAG-ALONG TRANSFER REQUEST FORMS <br/></b>Tag-Along Transfer Requests will be available for online submission only beginning May 26. Tag-Along allows for children of principals, assistant principals, guidance counselors, teachers, coaches, other certified school employees, and classified employees regularly assigned to or employed on a full-time basis at a school in grades kindergarten through twelve to attend the school in which they are assigned or a school in the feeder pattern of their assigned school.

<h1>Coronavirus Update #18 - 4/27/20: JP Schools Announces Grading &amp; Promotion Adjustments for All Students</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has announced how it will handle student grades, grade promotion, and graduation decisions with school buildings closed through the end of the academic year. This information is available now at jpschools.org/grades. </p>
<p>“We are being intentionally student-friendly with these policy shifts. The last thing I want to do is punish a child for a situation completely out of their control,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley. “The remainder of our school year will be an opportunity for students to improve their grades for the year while continuing to learn new content.”</p>
<p>As of Monday, April 27, students can complete at-home learning assignments for a grade. These additional assignments are meant to benefit students and can only improve final grades. </p>
<p>“While these assignments are not mandatory nor required, we encourage families to participate in every learning opportunity available to maintain a continuity of learning until our last day of school on May 21,” said Dr. Brumley. “ The more our students engage academically this spring, the more ready they will be for their next grade level.” </p>
<p>Families with questions about their child’s options should email their teacher. Teacher email addresses can be found on each school website. School websites are linked at jpschools.org/schools. The district has also opened a hotline for families who need academic support. The hotline number is 504-349-8999. The call center will be open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The full grading and promotion adjustments can be viewed at jpschools.org/grades.</p>
<p><b>Elementary and Middle School Students</b></p>
<p>Students with internet access should continue accessing and utilizing online resources at jpschools.org/learnathome.  Students without internet access should complete a third round at-home learning packet to receive a 4th quarter grade. Packets will be available April 28 and 30 at all Grab &amp; Go sites.</p>
<p><b>High School Students</b></p>
<p>High school students will be given the opportunity to complete online at-home learning activities to improve their grades. Students who were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits. If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, their final grades will be averages of the previous quarters. </p>
<p>High school seniors may elect to receive either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits. If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing the short Google Form at jpschools.org/grades.</p>

<p>The final grade for the semester will average the 3rd quarter grade with the 4th quarter online learning activities. The online learning activities shall not negatively impact the final grade. The completion of online learning activities will only serve to improve a grade, not lower a grade. </p>
<p><strong>Are the</strong> <strong>4th quarter</strong> <strong>at-home learning assignments mandatory?</strong></p>
<p>These assignments are encouraged but are not mandatory nor required. Students are being given the opportunity to improve their final grades with the at-home activities.  However, students that were failing a course or enrolled in a ½ credit course will need to complete and pass online activities to earn Carnegie credits.</p>
<p>If a student does not complete 4th quarter at-home learning assignments, his/her final grades will be averages of the previous quarter(s). </p>

<li>Opt for an “Administrative Withdrawal” and exit the course with no credit and nothing posted to the official college transcript.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can students still take the Advanced Placement tests?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  A new (at home) online test is available to allow students the opportunity to earn college credit and placement. Contact your school counselor for more information or visit the <a href=""https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/exam-dates-and-fees?affiliateId=ap%7Chome&amp;bannerId=cal%7Capc-examdates"">AP website </a>for testing information. </p>
<p><strong>What if a student is enrolled in a ½ credit course?</strong></p>
<p>Students enrolled in a ½ credit course for the 4th quarter must complete the course assignments in PLATO or Google Classroom to be awarded credit.</p>
<p><strong>What if a student completed an at-home learning packet?</strong></p>
<p>The at-home learning packets distributed at our 13 Grab and Go sites will not be graded nor counted towards a 4th quarter grade. These packets are for academic enrichment purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>SENIORS ONLY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will seniors receive a letter grade or can they choose a Pass/Fail option?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Families may elect either a course letter grade or a course pass/fail grade for high school credits.</li>

<li>If the Pass/Fail option is chosen, all spring semester courses will be awarded the grade of Pass/Fail. A Pass/Fail acknowledgment form must be requested from the high school.</li>
<li>If families want to elect the Pass/Fail option, please reach out to your school counselor by completing<a href=""https://forms.gle/EPipELPUokz9WqeB8""> this short Google Form</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do seniors still need to complete the financial aid requirement?</strong></p>
<p>No. The financial aid planning graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors.  Despite this requirement being waived, families are encouraged to apply online by visiting <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"">the FAFSA website</a>.  </p>
<p>In addition to state financial aid programs (e.g. TOPS and LA Go Grant), there are Federal Student Aid programs that require FAFSA completion, including:</p>

<li>Graduating seniors eligible under ACT 833</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if a TOPS Tech Diploma senior needs an IBC credential to be eligible to graduate?</strong></p>
<p>The IBC terminal graduation requirement has been waived for graduating seniors. Graduating seniors will be eligible to graduate with a TOPS Tech Diploma without earning the IBC credential. </p>
<p><strong>Is there an exception for the TOPS Core GPA due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>No. TOPS requires a minimum TOPS Core GPA of 2.50.  This requirement still applies even if a student chooses to receive Pass/Fail grades from the high school.  Parents should take this into account and make careful consideration before selecting this option.</p>
<p><strong>If seniors have not had the opportunity to take the ACT, will this be waived so these students can graduate?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Seniors are not required to test as a condition of graduation. However, ACT exam options are available in June 2020 if students want to take the exam to qualify for TOPS eligibility.  </p>
<p><strong>What if a senior cannot meet the 25-hour requirement to earn a Community Service Seal due to school closures?</strong></p>
<p>The 25-hour requirement has been waived for 2019-2020 seniors.  If students have met the requirements for their freshmen sophomore, and junior years, they may be awarded the diploma seal.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #15 - 4/16/20: Jefferson Parish Schools Moves Class of 2020 Graduations to July</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools is moving its high school graduations to July in an effort to preserve in-person commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2020. The district announced that graduations for 14 of its 15 senior classes will now take place in July. </p>
<p>“Senior year is one of the most memorable times of our kids’ lives, and the pinnacle of this time is the commencement ceremony,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley. “We’re doing everything in our power to make this moment special for the Class of 2020. Our seniors deserve a traditional graduation and I want to do all we can to make that possible.“ </p>
<p>District leaders made the switch with the hope it will be safe to gather for an appropriate celebration by July. Commencement ceremonies for all JP Schools graduating classes except Grand Isle School, JCFA Charter, and Kenner Discovery Charter High will take place July 6-9 at the Pontchartrain Center. Should it not be safe to hold in-person commencement ceremonies by July, the schools will instead hold virtual graduations in mid-July. Grand Isle School will hold its ceremony in the school’s gymnasium July 10. Kenner Discovery Charter High will be releasing information soon about their graduation plans.  JCFA Charter will hold its graduation July 14 at La Maison Creole in Harvey.</p>
<p>The ceremonies will be abbreviated and include additional safety measures. Speeches and performances will be limited and invitations will be reduced. The district will record each graduation and make those videos available online. Schools will communicate information about diploma pick-up and commencement ceremonies to families. The district is announcing this change now to give families as much notice as possible.</p>
<p>JP Schools commencement ceremonies were scheduled to start May 9 and conclude May 17. There are over 2,600 high school seniors in Jefferson Parish Schools. Fifteen schools in the district have a 2020 graduating class: Bonnabel High, East Jefferson High, Fisher Middle-High, Grace King High, Grand Isle School, Haynes Academy, Helen Cox High, Higgins High, JCFA Charter, John Ehret High, Kenner Discovery Charter High, Patrick F. Taylor Academy, Thomas Jefferson Academy, and West Jefferson High.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #14 - 4/15/20: All Louisiana School Buildings Will Remain Closed Through the Remainder of the 2019-20 School Year</h1>

<p>Dear JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Today, Governor Edwards announced that all Louisiana school buildings will remain closed through the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. This is difficult news to hear, but we fully support the Governor’s decision. The safety of our students and employees is our top responsibility. Our state has made great progress towards flattening the curve, and we all must do everything in our power to ensure the trend continues.</p>
<p>This announcement means our buildings remain closed. As we have learned over the past month, “school” is much more than a building. School will continue until students’ last day on May 21. Just like it has throughout the closure, learning will continue in Jefferson Parish Schools. Our at-home learning resources are available to students in multiple forms and delivery methods.</p>
<p>Families with internet access should visit <a href=""http://jpschools.org/LearnAtHome"">jpschools.org/LearnAtHome</a>. That’s our digital hub for a diverse offering of lessons, daily schedules, as well as self-guided, student-specific online programs. We also encourage families to email their teachers, as many educators have started offering online lessons through Google Classroom. Since schools closed in mid-March, we have trained over 2,000 educators (and counting) on Google Classroom. </p>
<p>For our families without the technology to access online resources, we will distribute a final round of learning packets at our Grab &amp; Go sites April 28 and 30 that will last through the end of the school year. We will also announce information this week about a laptop loaner program for the final five weeks of school. </p>
<p>Our Grab &amp; Go sites will provide meals on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule through the end of the school year. We will also maintain operation of our academic and emotional support call centers. </p>
<p>I know you have questions about what this means for your child. As a parent of school-age children, I share many of your same concerns. Louisiana is not the first state to make this difficult decision, and it won’t be the last. As we began seeing states make this call and the number of coronavirus cases rise in our region, we started planning for this possibility. Continue to visit <a href=""http://jpschools.org/coronavirus"">jpschools.org/coronavirus</a> for the most recent district updates, resources, and a running list of frequently asked questions. Teachers and principals will also be available via email for school specific questions.</p>
<p>Your school will be your first line of communication. We all learned about the Governor’s decision today during his public announcement. This includes our principals, teachers, and support staff. They will be in contact with families about what this means for their child. Please be patient as our educators learn and prepare information to share. If you haven’t done so before, make a habit of regularly visiting your school’s website. Those web addresses can be found at <a href=""http://jpschools.org/schools"">jpschools.org/schools</a>.</p>
<p>I wish we had answers to all your questions right now, but we don’t. We have done our best to prepare for this situation while simultaneously leading the district through day-to-day realities of this unprecedented public health crisis. There are many moving parts and pieces. We want to make sure they all fit and work smoothly together. Please continue to check our website, free Jefferson Parish School mobile app, and our social media pages for the latest updates. As we learn more information, we will share it with you. </p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #13 - 4/9/20: LHSAA Announces Cancellation of Remaining Winter &amp; Spring Sports</h1>

<p>The Louisiana High School Athletic Association has made the decision to cancel all remaining winter and spring sports for the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>""This decision was not in haste and was discussed with tremendous concern for those senior athletes being affected,"" said LHSAA Executive Director Eddie Bonine. ""We realize and concur with the argument about retuning to normalcy and allowing seniors to have their moment, just like we did for boys' basketball championships, unfortunately, circumstances today are tremendously different than circumstances were that week in March. We understand the hardships and disappointments everyone, especially the class of 2020, is enduring due to the closure of schools facilities, but our unwavering focus must now remain on doing our part by continuing to follow any and all mitigation measures set forth by our Governor.""</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #11 - 4/2/20: Governor Edwards Extends School Closures Until At Least April 30</h1>

<p>Dear JP Schools Family,</p>
<p>Today, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that he is extending school closures in the state until at least April 30. This coincides with President Trump’s announcement this past weekend to extend the national social distancing guidelines until April 30.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of a national health crisis, and I fully support the Governor’s decision to keep kids home. While we were prepared for schools to reopen April 15, we’ve also planned for this extension. We remain committed to providing students, families, and the community with as much support as possible during this unprecedented time.</p>
<p>We will continue to operate our Grab &amp; Go meal program and provide families with optional at-home learning resources.</p>
<p>We’ll also continue to operate our Emotional Support Line. Experienced mental health professionals are available via telephone to provide emotional support and share any pertinent resources during these difficult times. Parents of JP Schools students and staff members may call (504) 349-7629 weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>
<p>To our high school seniors, know that you are still the Class of 2020, and I look forward to signing each and every one of your diplomas. We are working on a process to ensure you have the opportunity to graduate this spring.</p>
<p>We are working to find creative solutions during these trying times. Nothing will match the support we provide children and families when our doors are open. We know our families need us now more than ever, and we are doing everything we can to step into the gap for them.</p>
<p>I know there will be many questions and growing pains. You can find frequently asked questions and additional information at <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/coronavirus"">jpschools.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you as we continue to partner together in educating our students.</p>
<p><br/>Dr. Brumley<br/>Superintendent<br/>Jefferson Parish Schools</p>

<p>Queridos Colegas,</p>
<p>Hoy, el gobernador John Bel Edwards anuncio que extenderá el cierre de escuelas en el estado hasta al menos el 30 de abril. Esto coincide con el anuncio del Presidente Trump el pasado fin de semana de extender las guías nacionales de distanciamiento social hasta el 30 de abril.</p>
<p>Estamos en medio de una crisis nacional de salud, y apoyo totalmente la decisión del gobernador de mantener a los niños en casa. Si bien estábamos preparados para que las escuelas reabrieran el 15 de abril, también hemos planeado para esta extensión. Seguimos comprometidos a proporcionas a los estudiantes, las familias y la comunidad el mayor apoyo posible durante este tiempo sin precedente.</p>
<p>Continuaremos operando nuestro programa de comidas Grab &amp; Go y brindaremos a las familias recursos de aprendizaje en el hogar.</p>
<p>También continuaremos operando nuestra Línea de Apoyo Emocional. Profesionales con experiencia en salud mental están disponibles por teléfono para brindar apoyo emocional y compartir los recursos pertinentes durante estos tiempos difíciles. Los padres de los estudiantes y miembros del personal de las escuelas de JP pueden llamar al (504) 349-7629 de lunes a viernes de 10 a.m. a 1 p.m. o de 4 p.m. a 6 p.m. para hablar con uno de nuestros profesionales capacitados en salud mental.</p>
<p>Para nuestros estudiantes de último año de secundaria, sepan que todavía son de la clase 2020, y espero firmar todos y cada uno de sus diplomas. Estamos trabajando en un proceso para garantizar que tengan la oportunidad de graduarse esta primavera.</p>
<p>Estamos trabajando para encontrar soluciones creativas durante estos tiempos difíciles. Nada igualará el apoyo que brindamos a los niños y las familias cuando nuestras puertas estén abiertas. Sabemos que nuestras familias nos necesitan ahora más que nunca, y estamos haciendo todo lo posible para abrirnos paso por ellos.</p>
<p>Sé que habrá muchas preguntas y dolores de crecimiento. Puede encontrar preguntas frecuentes e información adicional en jpschools.org/coronavirus.</p>
<p>Gracias por todos ustedes mientras continuamos colaborando juntos en la educación de nuestros estudiantes.</p>

<h1>Coronavirus Update #10 - 4/2/20: JP Schools Announces Friday Changes to Meals and Packet Distribution</h1>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools has announced two changes to the support it is providing families. While families will still be served meals for every day of the week at the district’s 13 Grab &amp; Go sites, weekend meals will not be provided until additional approval is granted by the USDA. The district is also consolidating its learning packet distribution to two sites for Friday: Bissonet Plaza Elementary and Gretna Middle.</p>
<p>JP Schools began a partnership with the Three O’Clock Project April 1 on its Grab &amp; Go meals program. The shift allows the district to serve the same amount of meals to students while only operating the sites three days a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). JP Schools and the Three O-Clock Project were originally given approval to serve weekend meals on Fridays. The USDA then notified the state this week that it was still weighing funding approval for the weekend meals. Families will continue to receive breakfasts and lunches for that day and the next on Monday and Wednesday, as well as lunch and breakfast on Friday. Jefferson Parish Schools has served over 125,000 meals to children since starting its Grab &amp; Go service March 18. </p>
<p>After passing out 43,000 printed learning packets on Monday and Wednesday, the district will consolidate packet distribution to two sites Friday: Bissonet Plaza Elementary at 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie and at Gretna Middle at 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna. Packets are available for all grade levels, but supply is limited. Families with home internet access are encouraged to use the district's online resources. The printed packets were created for families unable to access the district’s online resources. The first and second round of packets, along with additional resources, can be found at jpschools.org/LearnAtHome.</p>
<p>The 13 Grab &amp; Go sites are open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thel sites will be closed April 10 to observe Good Friday. The locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bissonet Plaza Elementary: 6818 Kawanee Drive in Metairie</li>
<li>Emmett Gilbert School: 435 S. Jamie Blvd. in Westwego</li>
<li>Fisher: 2529 Jean Lafitte Blvd. in Lafitte</li>
<li>Gretna Middle: 910 Gretna Blvd. in Gretna</li>

<li>Woods Elementary: 1037 31st Street in Kenner</li>
<li>Worley Middle: 801 Spartans Drive in Westwego</li>
</ul>
<p>Eighty-two percent of the families in JP Schools are economically disadvantaged. </p>
<p>Three O’Clock Project (TOP) is a nonprofit organization. Their mission is to provide healthy meals and nutrition education for at-risk students after school. </p>
<p>Meals will be provided to all children age 18 and under without charge. Acceptance and participating requirements for the program and all activities are the same for all regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, or retaliation for prior civil rights activity in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA and there will be no discrimination in the course of the meal service. Jefferson Parish Schools is an equal opportunity provider.</p>

<p>Jefferson Parish Schools recognizes the significant impact that COVID-19 and the subsequent school closures are having on the emotional well being of many of our families and staff. In order to provide emotional support, we created an Emotional Support Line for parents and staff members.</p>
<p>Starting March 31, experienced mental health professionals will be available via telephone to provide emotional support and share any pertinent resources during these difficult times. Parents of Jefferson Parish Schools students and staff members may call (504) 349-7629, Monday – Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. or between 4 to 6 p.m. to speak to one of our trained mental health professionals.</p>

<p>JP Schools is partnering with the Three O’Clock Project to offer children enough meals for all seven days of the week starting April 1. The partnership will also allow the district to deliver meals to students in areas where traveling to a Grab &amp; Go site is more challenging for families, </p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 1, the district’s 13 Grab &amp; Go sites will change from operating five days a week to being open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Children will begin receiving breakfast and lunch for that day and the following day on Mondays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, children will receive enough breakfasts and lunches to last through the weekend.</p>
<p>“We are here for all children and this partnership will allow us to reach even farther into the community to serve more families,” said JP Schools Superintendent Dr. Cade Brumley.  “I’m grateful to our employees and community partners who continue to go the extra mile for our kids.

<p><em>As this would be a standalone virtual school, students would be assigned to the virtual school as their home school. They would not be able to participate in athletics or extra-curricular activities at other schools in the district.</em></p>
<p><strong>Time Allocation for Teacher-Guided Learning/Self-Guided Learning</strong></p>
<p>As students become more self-disciplined and acclimated to self-paced learning, the time allocation for learning will shift. This shift will likely begin to occur in late 9th grade and continuously shift through the high school courses.</p>
<p><strong>School/Family/Learner Expectations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students will have an embedded learning management system which will provide the student and parent easy access to track attendance, progress, and assignments</li>
<li>Students will be assigned two morning classes, intermission/lunch, and two afternoon classes</li>
<li>Students will be provided standard courses for both graduation pathways</li>
<li>Students will be provided Dual Enrollment opportunities</li>
<li>Students will be provided opportunities for honors courses, if qualified</li>
<li>Students will be provided synchronous activities to reinforce lessons with transition time for assignments, <br/>group work, and interventions</li>
<li>Students must provide their own transportation to the designated campus to complete in-person state mandated assessments, e.g. Benchmarks, LEAP 2025, ELPT, WorkKeys, ACT, etc.</li>
<li>Students must attend class daily during the regular school day</li>
<li>Students must follow the adopted academic calendar of Jefferson Parish Schools</li>
<li>Students must have reliable at-home internet service</li>

<h1>Google Gmail Transition</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>We want to make it easier for people to share information. One of the action steps outlined in <a href=""/site/Default.aspx?PageID=370"">INTERNAL LINK 2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve</a> is to modernize the district's email system. Jefferson Parish Schools is upgrading to Google's G Suite for Education, which will include Gmail for all employees. Employees have officially started using their new Gmail accounts September 3, 2019. </p>
<p>With the new JP Gmail system, email addresses are automatically created from the official employee name listed in our Business Plus (BP) Human Resources system. To be consistent across the district, the name listed in BP must match the name listed on the teaching certificate for certified employees or on the drivers license for classified employees. If you need to change your name, you can access the Name Change form through the Employee Portal.</p>
<p>As with any change, there will be some adjustments and bumps in the road. This page will be updated with resources and important dates to remember in order to make this transition as smooth as possible.</p>

<h1>Additional Information</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>In addition to moving to Google Gmail, we are changing our email domain name from @jppss.k12.la.us, to @jpschools.org. The new email address format is firstname.lastname@jpschools.org. Last names may include a hyphenated name, and last names of employees with the same name may be followed by a number (firstname.lastname2@jpschools.org).</p>
<p><strong>Email History:</strong> Currently, some history from GroupWise has been moved to Gmail. After the transition, one year of history will be available in Gmail. Up to two additional years of history will be available on GroupWise WebAccess; however, each month, one month of history will expire until all two years of history have expired in GroupWise. Gmail will retain email history thereafter. GroupWise WebAccess can be found by going to our jpschools.org webpage, Employees, Resources, and clicking GroupWise WebAccess in the left menu.</p>
<p><strong>Proxy, Groups, Folders, and Labels:</strong> Items moved from GroupWise to Gmail include emails, contacts, and calendar events. Most calendar and email proxy accounts should remain; however, in some cases, you may need to set them up again. Note that Personal Contact Groups have been converted to Labels in your Google contact list. GroupWise Global Contact Groups have been converted to Google Groups, and Email Folders in GroupWise have been converted to Gmail Labels.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Service Password Reset:</strong> A Self-Service Password Reset process has been added to allow you to reset your password at any time and from anywhere. See the document attached above (How to use Self-Service Password Reset) for directions. For security, you will maintain your own password and others will not be able create a password for you.</p>
<p><strong>iPhones and iPads (IOS Devices):</strong> The Apple Mail and Calendar apps on iPhones and iPads do not work well with Gmail. Therefore, to get email and your calendar on a phone, the Gmail and Google Calendar apps must be downloaded from the Apple App Store. The attached document above (Installing Gmail and Calendar Apps on Apple iPhones and iPads) will guide you through the process of downloading and setting up the two apps. Google does not provide an app for Contacts. The same document provides steps to include your Google Contacts on your iPhone and iPad.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p><strong>Why am I being evaluated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JP Schools performance evaluations are designed to provide all employees with increased opportunities for professional growth and development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does the evaluation process begin?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Employees meet with their immediate supervisor, to complete the Beginning of the Year: Goal Setting Form. The form sets the goals, performance indicators and expectations that Support Employees will be evaluated on throughout the school year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How often do I get evaluated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Employees are not formally evaluated until the end of the school year. During the End of Year Evaluation, each Support Employee will receive a score for each competency, performance indicator and goal.
<ul>
<li>After the completion of the Beginning of the Year: Goal Setting Form, your immediate supervisor may conduct observations and give feedback throughout the school year, leading up to the formal evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who is required to receive an evaluation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All JP Schools employees are evaluated every year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who will evaluate me?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Employees are evaluated by the Immediate Supervisor, Principal, or his or her designee.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will I know if I’m doing a good job?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the evaluation process, communication between you and your immediate supervisor is strongly encouraged. Discussions regarding performance occur between the immediate supervisor and the employee throughout the process. By doing this, you as the employee will have opportunities to refine and enhance your skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if I do not sign the End of Year Evaluation Form?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your signature on the final evaluation form does not signify that you agree with the evaluation, but rather that you acknowledge receipt of your final evaluation. If you choose not to sign the evaluation, the process will continue without your signature.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Dandridge Community Task Force</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>In July 2008, JP Schools began operating schools consistent with the terms of the Dandridge Court Order (“Court Order”) to make sure all students received an equitable education. The school board created policy consistent with the expectations outlined in the Court Order, and the Compliance Office mirrored the same actions by aligning its operating procedures with the policy and Order.</p>
<p>Currently, JP Schools is under a <a href=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/890/final-settlement-agreement-8-2-11.pdf"">Final Settlement Agreement (click here)</a> because the Court recognized that JP Schools was operating seamlessly as one system, and granted the district unitary status in many areas. The areas not meeting unitary criteria are identified in the Agreement.</p>
<p>The Dandridge Task Force serves as a liaison between the community and JPPSS through the Compliance Office. The Task Force holds community meetings to address concerns and answer questions from our stakeholders, and to report the status of the Agreement and its implementation.</p>
<p>JP Schools understands the commitment, levels of accountability and responsibilities associated with successfully serving all of our students without court supervision. Our commitment to academic excellence ensures that all of our students are receiving the world class education that they deserve.</p>

<h1>Dandridge Community Task Force</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>In July 2008, JP Schools began operating schools consistent with the terms of the Dandridge Court Order (“Court Order”) to make sure all students received an equitable education. The school board created policy consistent with the expectations outlined in the Court Order, and the Compliance Office mirrored the same actions by aligning its operating procedures with the policy and Order.</p>
<p>Currently, JP Schools is under a <a href=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/890/final-settlement-agreement-8-2-11.pdf"">Final Settlement Agreement (click here)</a> because the Court recognized that JP Schools was operating seamlessly as one system, and granted the district unitary status in many areas. The areas not meeting unitary criteria are identified in the Agreement.</p>
<p>The Dandridge Task Force serves as a liaison between the community and JPPSS through the Compliance Office. The Task Force holds community meetings to address concerns and answer questions from our stakeholders, and to report the status of the Agreement and its implementation.</p>
<p>JP Schools understands the commitment, levels of accountability and responsibilities associated with successfully serving all of our students without court supervision. Our commitment to academic excellence ensures that all of our students are receiving the world class education that they deserve.</p>

<h1>Discovery Days 2018</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Discovery Days were originally part of Dr. Brumley's 100-day entry plan. They were developed as a way to understand the district from as many viewpoints as possible. The insight he gained during these first nine Discovery Days helped create the district's strategic plan, <em><a href=""/site/Default.aspx?PageID=370"">INTERNAL LINK 2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve</a></em>. This school year's stops included Fisher Middle-High, Harris Middle, Pitre Elementary, Alexander Elementary, Riviere Elementary, Cherbonnier-Rillieux Elementary, Gretna Middle, Adams Middle, and Strehle Elementary.</p>

<p>As a means to solicit feedback and give our stakeholders a seat at the table, Superintendent Dr. James Gray carries on the tradition of leading five Superintendent Councils. These councils are broken down by audience to include the Superintendent's Student Council, Parent Council, Teacher Council, Principal Council and Special Education Council. In its fourth year running, the councils provide critical insight to help inform and improve decisions being made at the district level, while establishing a regular connection point between Dr. Gray and stakeholders. The Superintendent's councils complement the work that is already taking place as outlined in <strong><em><a href=""/site/Default.aspx?PageID=370"">INTERNAL LINK 2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve</a>.</em></strong></p>

<h2>2021-22 Superintendent's Councils Announced</h2>

<p>JP Schools held an application period prior to Hurricane Ida and again earlier this month for the five Superintendent’s Councils. Each council will meet multiple times this school year to help inform and improve decisions being made at the district level.

<h1>2021-22 Parent Council</h1>

<p><strong>April 7: </strong>The final Superintendent Parent Council meeting included an introduction from Gabrielle Misfeldt, Chief of Staff, where she played a video on the importance of knowing your why. The council was instructed to turn to their partner and express what their why’s are as parents. A few of those answers were: </p>
<ul>
<li>To advance adult and parent learners, not just kids </li>
<li>Advocate for teachers </li>
<li>Empower and unite other families </li>
<li>Have a more in depth understanding of kids’ challenges </li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting shifted to a focus on communications where Ted Beasley and Paris Vinnett, two members of the communication team, gave a presentation on the district’s communications department. Followed by the presentation, parents shared their thoughts on what works well and what could be done better or differently in terms of communication. The members were then asked to fill out a communications feedback form where they were asked to provide feedback on how they prefer to receive communication, district and school communication they find beneficial, and any additional comments about communications that may be helpful. Examples of some responses included: </p>
<p>School-wide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need for more communication at high school level </li>
<li>Too short notice of parent teacher conferences</li>
<li>Desire for district-wide standard for school communication </li>
<li>More user friendly school websites</li>
<li>Would like updated school social media policies </li>
</ul>
<p>District-wide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer text messages as primary method of communication </li>
<li>Would like students to access text messages </li>
<li>Bus communication is sent with not enough advance notice </li>
<li>Would like audit of district website </li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting concluded with Dr. Gray thanking the council members for being part of this process. He then answered his last round of rapid fire questions. .  </p>
<p><strong>February 10: </strong>The Parent Group council began with Gabe Misfeldt, Chief of Staff, opening the meeting with a bingo icebreaker to help participants get to know one another better.</p>
<p>Following the icebreaker activity. AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, addressed the council regarding student and staff mental health. Pethe mentioned that he is a product of Jefferson Parish Schools, as he graduated from Grace King High School and is also a parent of  students in the school system. “I have a lot of ties to this district and it's important to me that you know that this work is personal for me,'' said Pethe. Pethe then explained CUE testing, a program in partnership with the Louisiana Department of Health that provides rapid COVID testing at all Jefferson Parish schools. “This program has been helpful because both students and our staff are missing less school.” </p>
<p>Pethe then touched on student wellness where he explained the district’s partnership with Children’s Hospital on the THRIVE KIDS Student Wellness care coordination program. He explained that care coordination is in place as a consent to communicate, not a consent  to treat. “This is about making sure that our kids with chronic medical conditions don't miss out on school.”</p>
<p>The parent council meeting then heard from Superintendent Dr. James Gray, where he stated, “My goal is not to say that we’re an A district, but to say that because we’re doing so well educating our kids, we’ve made the whole district better.” </p>
<p>The parents then participated in a rapid fire where they expressed areas of concerns and offered suggestions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Website optics</li>
<li>Normalcy for extracurricular activities</li>
<li>Kids cyberbullying teachers on social media </li>
<li>Wanting to be more involved </li>
<li>Inappropriate texts from other students </li>
<li>Children being hit by SPED kids in the classroom and not being removed </li>
<li>Teachers not controlling the classroom</li>
<li>Quarantining</li>
<li>Mental health issues </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>December 16: </strong>The Superintendent’s Parent Council group was led by Gabrielle Misfeldt, Chief of Staff. The council began with an icebreaker where parents introduced themselves and were asked to name a positive event that took place within the last 20 months despite the difficulties that have occurred in relation to the pandemic and Hurricane Ida. </p>
<p>Parents named good things that have happened such as expecting new children, seamless transitions to temporary school campuses, purchasing new businesses, their child becoming a ranked tennis player, and their child making a cheerleading squad. </p>
<p>The group then broke into small groups to collaboratively brainstorm possible topics to discuss at upcoming council meetings. The topics were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bullying</li>
<li>Improving communication between teacher and parents </li>
<li>COVID-19 testing and safety protocols </li>
<li>Student Inclusion </li>
<li>Curriculum concerns </li>
<li>More funding and encouragement of student participation in athletics </li>
<li>Stronger parental involvement</li>
<li>Ways to better nurture and uplift children </li>
<li>School safety protocols </li>
<li>Year round school </li>
<li>Teacher and student mental health </li>
<li>Campus upgrades, repairs, maintenance, and modernization </li>
<li>Lack of Social workers and therapists </li>
<li>Lack of celebratory events and extracurricular activities </li>
<li>More diverse faculty members</li>
<li>Better enforcement of bullying policy </li>
</ul>

<p>The group was then introduced to Dr. Gray where he shared about his upbringing. He explained that his second grade teacher and high school basketball coach saw potential in him, and ultimately influenced him to become a teacher. </p>

<p>The council members then took place in a rapid fire, a session that entailed each council member asking a specific question or making a general comment to the Superintendent regarding a topic they would like to discuss further. These topics included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity to displaced parents and families due to Hurricane Ida </li>
<li>Ensuring the emotional needs of children are met </li>
<li>Yearly campus evaluations </li>
<li>Safety protocols for campuses with older kids on campus </li>
<li>Plan to address the increase in fights </li>
<li>Lack of extracurricular activities beside sports </li>
<li>Budget allocations </li>
<li>Bus driver shortages </li>
<li>Teachers understanding their power to make or break a child </li>
<li>Councils set up at each school</li>

<h3><strong>2020-21 Parent Council Recaps</strong></h3>

<p><strong>April 13:</strong> At the fourth and final meeting of the Superintendent’s Parent Council meeting, Gabrielle Misfeldt, Chief of Staff, opened the meeting with a heartwarming and inspirational video about unsung heroes. This has been a challenging year for everyone, and our parents, teachers, administration and school employees have demonstrated heroic efforts to ensure students receive the education they deserve. The primary focus of the meeting was to preview and garner feedback on our summer learning programs. The Jefferson Summer Learning Program will provide students with additional opportunities for accelerated learning and enrichment during the summer months. The 2021 summer program will be expanded in duration, attendance and content to address learning loss resulting from pandemic learning. Goals for the program include:</p>
<p>Prepare students for the next school year and accelerate any learning gaps in Math and ELA<br/>Partner with local and national organizations to offer enrichment activities that foster joy and engagement and develop the whole child<br/>Safely interact with peers in-person and build a sense of community<br/>Overall, parents were excited about the opportunities for enrichment and were favorable of the emphasis on acceleration to catch all students up. The group then broke into small groups to discuss how the summer program is marketed and communicated to families, strategies to drive participation, and opportunities to change the perception of summer programs from remediation to exciting acceleration and enrichment.</p>
<p>Superintendent Dr. James Gray concluded the meeting with a review of our progress towards 2024: The Future our Kids Deserve including infrastructure improvements, increased technology, professional development for teachers and much more. During his first year as Superintendent, these councils have provided an opportunity for the community to get to know him and the work we’re doing at the district level while, in turn, providing a forum for two-dialogue to shape our work.</p>
<p><strong>February 11:</strong> Dr. Gray opened the third Superintendent Parent Council with an update on district and state initiatives. Recently, the Louisiana Department of Education released its Believe to Achieve educational priorities. This plan aligns closely with the goals we have set forth in 2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve. As part of the LDOE’s plan to reduce the learning gap resulting from the pandemic, JPS has been awarded a $70k grant to offer tutoring and summer school programs. Other ways JPS plans to reach these shared goals is through a focus on early childhood literacy and programs that ensure students graduate career and college ready.</p>
<p>Gabrielle Misfeldt, Chief of Staff, shared an inspirational video and team building activity on the importance of shared leadership. When geese fly in formation, their flight range is extended by 77%. Similarly, when we tackle hard tasks together and embrace interdependence, we are more effective and can better support our students, teachers and support employees.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ms. Misfeldt provided an update on initiatives we have been working on based on input from the Parent Council, including another round of Parent Computer Workshops as an added support for families and increased communication via the launch of an all stakeholder newsletter, The Jefferson Journal.</p>
<p>Germaine Gilson, Chief of District Affairs, led a discussion focused on the 2021-22 academic calendar. First and foremost, we want to develop a calendar that is student, teacher and family centered. Listed below are some other points taken into consideration when creating the Academic Calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the summer learning slide</li>
<li>Provides frequent breaks, while eliminating mid-week breaks to the extent possible</li>
<li>Provide opportunities for district professional development</li>
<li>Adheres to the required 63,720 instructional minutes</li>
<li>Honors the 183 teacher contract days</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council discussed factors that can impact the calendar, including holiday breaks and Parent/Teacher Conference Days. Council members would prefer the flexibility of scheduling Parent/Teacher conferences over a designated week and to have the option of in-person or virtual meetings. Additionally, Ms. Gilson presented an opportunity to incorporate intersession days to offer targeted interventions and enrichment opportunities for students. Following the meeting, the group provided formal feedback on the 2021-22 Academic Calendar to be considered by the calendar committee.</p>
<p>To wrap up, AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, provided the Parent Council with a brief health and safety update. He shared encouraging information that the number of positive COVID cases reported in our schools has decreased week after week following the winter holiday. Continuing to follow our mitigation strategies, like mask wearing and implementing quarantines, will help keep our schools safe. He also shared that of the employees who’ve completed our vaccine questionnaire, 74% are interested in receiving the vaccine when it’s our turn.</p>
<p><strong>December 17:</strong> The second Superintendent’s Parent Council provided an opportunity for parents to weigh in on important topics to build and strengthen family and school partnerships. These partnerships are essential to helping students achieve their maximum potential.</p>
<p>Some of the hot topics for the Parent Council included technology and virtual learning, parent engagement, student engagement and emotional as well as academic support for students suffering as a result of the pandemic. How we can better support the mental health of our families and employees continues to be a focus area for the district, and an issue Dr. Gray addressed directly in his remarks to the group.</p>
<p>After the conversation with Dr. Gray, parents engaged in a candid conversation around the strengths and challenges of this year. In particular, the group discussed the implications of virtual learning. We are sharing this recap to be transparent with all of our families and because we used feedback from last year to ensure this information gets out to the group:</p>
<p>SUCCESSES OF VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution of devices orderly, logistical</li>
<li>Devices used during in person instruction along with virtual</li>
<li>Many assignments completed in Google Classroom - parents can see lessons/assignments (some school sites)</li>

<li>Students are learning transferable skills idea - execution, problem solving</li>
<li>Text communication from School Board</li>
<li>Learning is occuring</li>
</ul>
<p>CHALLENGES OF VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION</p>

<li>Managing virtual vs in-class at the same time</li>
<li>Additional challenges for students with diverse needs</li>

<li>Families who are virtual feel disconnected from the in-person classroom.</li>
<li>In-person students get more attention</li>
<li>Teacher comfort with technology</li>
<li>Engagement with schools (parent/teacher interaction)</li>
<li>Proper nutrition for virtual students</li>
<li>Communication of events</li>
<li>Extra Curricular Activities</li>

</ul>
<p>SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT</p>
<ul>

<li>Incentives for parent participation and involvement (virtual PTO mtg)</li>
<li>Expected response for email communication</li>
<li>Mutual expectations (parents/teachers)</li>
<li>Distribution of protocol for virtual learning</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Syllabus of assignments</li>
<li>Meals for virtual students</li>
<li>Communication with students progress more frequently</li>
<li>Monitoring the virtual students</li>
<li>Ensure parents know how to log into JCampus, technology platforms - create instructional videos - youtube</li>
</ul>
<p>These Superintendent’s Council meetings provide valuable insights to inform and improve our decisions at the district level. Additionally, there will be opportunities to collaborate and learn from one another. We will continue to share these meeting recaps with you and deliver solutions to improve school performance and ease pressure points.</p>
<p><strong>November 11:</strong> At the first Superintendent’s Council meetings of the year, members laid the groundwork and set the agenda for future meetings. While the group is diverse in their positions and opinions on different issues, it is unanimous that everyone in the group wants the best for the students of Jefferson Parish. Each member brings with them a unique experience and perspective to help achieve our common goal.</p>
<p>For many in the group, this was their first time having a dialogue with Dr. Gray in his new role as Superintendent. He gave the group insight into his personal and professional background to help everyone understand his approach to district-level decisions. Dr. Gray emphasized the importance of understanding the “why” behind some of the decisions we made this year. He recognized that these are challenging times and that the situation asks a lot of our educators. However, it’s important that we stay motivated. When we approach this difficult work with a positive mindset, it puts us all in a better position to be successful.</p>
<p>Following an open conversation with Dr. Gray, we reviewed the “Three Big Rocks” as the foundation of Teaching and Learning in Jefferson Parish Schools. This gave parents an opportunity to better understand our rigorous, high-quality Tier 1 curriculum and district processes to support teachers. By relying on the Three Big Rocks, we continue to move forward and improve student and school performance year after year.</p>
<p>These Superintendent’s Council meetings provide valuable insights to inform and improve our decisions at the district level. Additionally, we hope these recaps provide you with a deeper understanding of how the district operates. We will continue to share these meeting recaps with you, and deliver solutions to improve school performance and the outcomes for all of our students.</p>

<h1>2021-22 Principal Council </h1>

<p><strong>April 4: </strong>The Superintendent's Principal Council began with an introduction from AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, where he welcomed the members and reviewed the meeting agenda. The group began with a team building activity where the principals broke into groups and were asked to share goals that they would like to accomplish off their bucket list this summer. </p>
<p>Following the team building activity was an introduction to a mental health wellness app that the district will provide to teachers, faculty, and staff as a way to help support mental health. The app offers mindfulness exercises, podcasts, relaxation techniques, and movement exercises. To test the app, the principals participated in chair yoga. </p>
<p>Following the chair yoga exercise was a presentation on monitoring led by Paulette Fairchild, the Director of IDEA where she gave a district breakdown on measurable goals, high school area of concerns, and  transitions as it relates to special education students. The council members were then asked to give feedback on how some of the weaknesses can be addressed as well as what were some of the district’s strengths. </p>
<p>The council members then broke into groups divided by elementary, middle, and high school principals where they discussed areas of improvement and strengths amongst their group. </p>
<p>The meeting concluded with Dr. Gray speaking to the principals on investing and building up  teachers so that the positive outcomes reflect on kids. “It’s important that we change the dynamic as to how others see teaching,” said Dr. Gray. “How do we get our teachers to speak highly of our profession so that we can get kids to go into education? '' asked Dr. Gray. “We have to figure out how to produce the next wave of educators, not only in JP Schools, but in society as a whole. What I want you all to be able to tell others is that education is hard, but I also want you to be able to tell them that it is rewarding. Look at trying times and trying people as sandpaper. It’s rough, but in the end it polishes you off. You all have done a lot of great things, and I’m proud of the work that you have done from withstanding the pandemic, to overcoming hurricanes.” </p>
<p><strong>February 9: </strong>The Superintendent’s Principal Council began with an introduction from AJ Pethe, the Chief of Schools. As a team building activity, each member of the council was given an excerpt from the book “The Power of Positive Leadership” by Jon Gordon. The principals were asked to have a conversation about the excerpt with the person next to them. Each principal was then asked to share with the group what from the excerpt resonated with them the most. “The purpose of this activity is to remind you of the important work that you do,” said Pethe. </p>
<p>Following the team building activity, the group was introduced to Sarah Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, where she explained more information about a digital timekeeping system the district will be implementing next school year. Sarah explained that this was an opportunity to hear from principals about what they may not be thinking about in terms of rolling out this new system. “We want to get every single principal’s feedback about this new system and where they would like this to be placed on their campus,” said Caruso. “Insight from our principals and other stakeholders is critical to rolling out this new system.” She then presented a demo of what the new system would look like and explained how it will work. </p>
<p>The principals then engaged with rapid fire questions, where they had an opportunity to ask questions or voice concerns to Caruso about the digital timekeeping system. </p>
<p>The group was then greeted by Donna Joseph, the Director of Human Resources, where she discussed recruitment and retention. “This is an opportunity for us to discuss how to address the phrase that has been coined as <i>the great resignation,</i> that exists not just in Jefferson Parish, but across our nation,” said Joseph. The council was given a pie chart that showed various efforts to recruit talent. She explained that these efforts may include performance tasks observations, viewing data that drive instruction, and then bringing these individuals to a committee of principals for selection. She also mentioned that the district participates in various career fairs held at several universities. Joseph also mentioned the district’s initiative to combat the teacher shortage by working more closely with career changers to get them certified to become teachers. Additionally, she explained the pipeline and how the district has plans underway to begin conducting teaching certification in-house through a program called EMBARK. </p>
<p>Joseph then encouraged principals to partner new teachers/career changer teachers or teachers who may not be certified with more veteran teachers so that they can make a smoother transition into the profession in order to retain that teacher and not create another vacancy. “We want our people to feel supported by the district, and let them know that we're doing everything to keep them,” said  Joseph. She added that the district created incentives for working at target schools that are classified as economically disadvantaged schools. “There is a $2,000 stipend. The district also offers 1,000 stipends to work in a shortage subject area.”</p>
<p>The  principals were then instructed to provide feedback on sticky notes about what worked today and what didn't. </p>
<p>The meeting concluded with a message from Dr. Gray where he shared his appreciation for the principals despite the unique challenges they have been faced with. </p>
<p>“The next five years are going to be critical for Jefferson Parish,” said Superintendent Dr.  James Gray. “We are working on retention efforts and will reveal what that looks like. Although the work that you do is hard and tough, I appreciate everything you do and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.” </p>
<p><strong>December 15: </strong>The Superintendent’s Principal Council began with a presentation led by Kimberly Buckingham, Thrive Kids Student Wellness Manager for Children’s Hospital. The presentation was centered on virtual care, a program that focuses on improving students’ academic performance through coordinated health care.</p>
<p>The principals then participated in a discussion led by mental health professionals Rochelle Gauthier and Monique Soignet. The council members discussed ways to improve social and emotional wellness, as well as ways to ensure that students and staff feel supported throughout the stressful life events taking place. They then engaged in group discussions where each group discussed ways to bridge social and emotional gaps amongst students. </p>
<p>The last part of the day concluded with a conversation led by Superintendent Dr. James Gray. He spoke to principals and encouraged them to provide feedback regarding what went well and what could be done better or differently for the next meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>2020-21 Principal Council Recaps</strong></h3>
<p><strong>April 14:</strong> At the fourth and final meeting of the Superintendent’s Principal Council meeting, AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, opened the meeting and welcomed the group. He then introduced Gabrielle Misfeldt, Chief of Staff, who led a team building activity focused on things our educators gained personally and professionally during the pandemic that they plan to continue. Some of our principals shared utilizing Google classroom and technology, while others dedicated more technology-free time with family. While this year has been challenging, each and everyone of us has gained something, taken up a new hobby or habit and grown in a positive way. It’s important we recognize those skills that will help us transition from this pandemic stronger than before.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the meeting was to preview and garner feedback on our summer learning programs. Laura Roussel, Chief Academic Officer, presented on the Jefferson Summer Learning Program and how it will provide students with additional opportunities for accelerated learning and enrichment during the summer months. She emphasized that it will be accelerated learning to focus on upcoming skills and create a strong bridge to the upcoming year as opposed to remediation, which covers content from the previous year. The 2021 summer program will be expanded in duration, attendance and content to address learning loss resulting from pandemic learning. Goals for the program include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare students for the next school year and accelerate any learning gaps in Math and ELA</li>
<li>Partner with local and national organizations to offer enrichment activities that foster joy and engagement and develop the whole child</li>
<li>Safely interact with peers in-person and build a sense of community</li>
</ul>
<p>The principals provided feedback on the criteria for which students will be invited to participate, while prioritizing student’s with the greatest need for content acceleration. Additionally, the group discussed ways to recruit teachers to allow for increased enrollment. We will communicate with all stakeholders as we finalize plans for the summer learning program, including a new name and brand that distinguishes it from previous summer schools.</p>
<p>Superintendent Dr. James Gray closed out the meeting with his appreciation for the Principal Council, and an update on our progress towards the priorities outlined in 2024: The Future our Kid Deserve. While this year has delivered unprecedented challenges, our schools continue to move forward. These councils have provided a lens into the work we’re doing at the district level to support and advance all schools while, in turn, providing a forum for two-way dialogue to shape our work.</p>
<p><strong>February 10:</strong> At the third Superintendent’s Principal Council meeting, AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, opened the meeting with an <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/99080962"">inspirational video</a> and team building activity on the importance of shared leadership. When geese fly in formation, their flight range is extended by 77%. Similarly, when we tackle hard tasks together and embrace interdependence, we are more effective and can better support our students, teachers and support employees.</p>
<p>Germaine Gilson, Chief of District Affairs, led a discussion focused on the 2021-22 academic calendar. First and foremost, we want to develop a calendar that is student, teacher and family centered. Listed below are some other points taken into consideration when creating the Academic Calendar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the summer learning slide </li>
<li>Provides frequent breaks, while eliminating mid-week breaks to the extent possible </li>
<li>Provide opportunities for district professional development</li>
<li>Adheres to the required 63,720 instructional minutes</li>
<li>Honors the 183 teacher contract days</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council discussed several other factors that can impact the calendar, including designated days for teacher preparation, professional development and Parent/Teacher conferences. Additionally, the group identified an opportunity to incorporate intercession days to offer targeted interventions for students and professional development for teachers. Following the meeting, the group provided formal feedback on the 2021-22 Academic Calendar to be considered by the calendar committee.</p>
<p>Additionally, the group delivered rapid fire discussion topics to Dr. Gray and the administration covering common themes including vaccinations, technology integration, LEAP and benchmark assessments, curriculum and SPED support. The feedback and insights garnered from these discussions will be used to improve our processes at the District level and ensure student and teacher success.</p>
<p>Dr. Gray ended the meeting by addressing the group and answering questions about plans for next year. Despite our best laid plans, he said, we may not be able to implement those plans depending on where we are as a parish and country. The district is reviewing options and making plans based on multiple factors. As we keep pushing towards the end of school, he talked about how like a sprinter, we must stay in control and at a steady pace to cross the finish line.  </p>
<p><strong>December 16:</strong> To wrap up the calendar year, we began the second Superintendent’s Principal Council meeting by setting our one-word intentions for the year. While 2020 was one of the most challenging years many of us have faced personally and professionally, we have a lot to be grateful for as we reflect on how far we have come as a school district. Principals around the room broke into small groups to set their intentions. The responses were inspiring and filled with optimism for what the future holds.</p>
<p>Through these Superintendent Council meetings, faculty meetings, our Start Strong survey and conversations with families, we’ve heard that student and employee mental health is an area of concern. Principals broke into small groups to discuss steps they can take towards improving the mental health on campus. Overall, the common theme was finding opportunities for individual connection and building relationships with students and employees.</p>
<p>Following the discussion, principals participated in a “Community Circle” exercise to build trust and respect utilizing restorative practices. Principals can bring back this new tool to facilitate group sharing to their schools and build Community Circles during faculty meetings and in the classroom. The Student Support team also rolled out cross-collaborative social and emotional rolling PD sessions to support educators' well-being, which are viewable here. We are fortunate to have more than 130 mental health and trauma-informed professionals working in the district to help support this effort.</p>
<p><strong>November 10: </strong>At the first Superintendent’s Principal Council meeting of the year, principals laid the groundwork to help set the agenda for future meetings. Dr. Gray welcomed the group and emphasized the importance to understanding and communicating the why and why we made some of the decisions we made this year. He recognized that these are challenging times and that the situation asks a lot of our educators. However, it’s important that we stay motivated and find our cheerleader. When we approach this difficult work with a positive mindset, it puts us all in a better position to be successful. </p>
<p>After the conversation with Dr. Gray, they engaged in a candid conversation around the strengths and challenges of this year. In particular, the group discussed the implications of virtual learning. We are sharing this recap to be transparent with all of our principals and because we used feedback from last year to ensure this information gets out to the group:</p>

<h1>2021-22 Special Education Council </h1>

<p><strong>April 7: </strong>The final Superintendent Special Education Council meeting began with Miriam Wall, a JP Schools social worker, presenting on two programs called Rethink and Second Step. These programs focus on meeting the needs of the special education population regarding broadcast and communication skills, how to ask questions, calming strategies, identifying feelings, social emotional learning, and emotion regulation. </p>
<p>The council members then participated in an ice breaker activity called Me Too, where the group read comments and whomever shared similarities, would step forward and say Me Too. Examples of some questions were: </p>
<ul>
<li>Are you a coffee or tea person? </li>
<li>What is your biggest fear?</li>
<li>If you could have anyone over for dinner, who would it be?</li>
<li>What kind of music do you like? </li>
<li>Are you a morning person or a night owl? </li>
</ul>
<p>Followed by the ice breaker activity, the council broke into two focus groups to discuss the IEP process in terms of what works well and what could be done better or differently. </p>
<p>The meeting concluded with Superintendent Dr. James Gray addressing the members by reiterating how important these councils are by bringing people together from unique backgrounds to hear their diverse perspective and allow for two way communications. Dr. Gray then took questions from the group, and parents thanked  Dr. Gray for the opportunity to meet and allowing them to speak authentically about their experiences. </p>
<p><strong>February 9</strong>: The second Superintendent's Special Education Council began with a welcome and introduction from AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools.</p>
<p>The council was introduced to Paulette Fairchilld, Director of IDEA, and she began the meeting with a  team building activity called Know Your Why. The council was shown a video excerpt from a public speaker who spoke about the power of knowing your why. The council members were then instructed to think about their personal why, why they applied to be on this council group, and what their purpose was. A quote displayed that read “When you know your why, your what has more impact because you’re walking in or towards your purpose” was displayed during the activity. </p>
<p>The council directed their attention to Dr. Rosemary Kerrin, a speaker who presented from the district’s Autism Support Team, where she explained the roles of the team and the support offered. The Autism Support Team’s focus is to provide support for students, schools, and families. They provide professional development for special education teachers through school visits, consultations, and modeling of materials and strategies. She also reviewed the goals of the support team which is to support students and families, be proactive with strategies for all students, and have multidisciplinary perspectives for problem solving. </p>
<p>The meeting concluded with a message from Dr. Gray. “We have needs in our district, but they will not be fixed instantly,” he said. ”I want you to be able to say that there is a stark contrast from where we were from the beginning of the year to where we are now. Your children are our children, and because they have such a unique set of needs, we are here to provide extra support to help them be successful.” </p>
<p>To offer context, Dr. Gray alo informed the council of some specific plans underway to address student mental and emotional health. Dr. Gray informed the council that the district is partnering with external mental health providers, hiring 11 additional external mental health providers, 117 JP social workers currently staffed, and hiring four additional external bilingual mental health providers. </p>
<p>The group then engaged in rapid fire topics. Concerns shared included: </p>
<ul>
<li>More professional development for special education teachers</li>
<li>The need for schools to host an FAQ session for parents with questions regarding IEP’s </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>December 16</strong>: The Superintendent’s Special Education Council was led by Ajit “AJ” Pethe, Chief of Schools. Mr. Pethe opened the meeting by introducing Paulette Fairchild, Director of IDEA for JP Schools. </p>
<p>After reviewing the meeting outcomes, the council members were asked to answer survey questions regarding how familiar they were with special education laws. The group was then shown a presentation on policies and procedures for special education students. Following the presentation, council members were provided information that explained where they could locate resources pertaining to special education policies and guidelines. After these resources were shared, the council members were asked to share areas of improvement regarding ways to better serve special education students. The areas of improvement were as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Educate parents on how to read an IEP</li>
<li>Find ways to make the IEP process less daunting and intimidating for parents </li>
<li>Implement more supportive messaging for special education </li>
<li>Divert more attention to parents of special education children who are unable to read, need larger print, are in need of interpretation, or are in need of computer access </li>
<li>Continue to partner with community partners such as Oschner </li>
<li>Provide more positive feedback to parents on the progress of their child </li>
</ul>
<p>The council then turned their focus to a discussion regarding social and emotional support.. Monique Soignet, Director of Family and Social Services, spoke to the council about social and emotional health and played a video that helped lay the groundwork for ways in which special education teachers can intentionally create learning experiences that help others become lifelong learners of social and emotional health.</p>
<p>The council meeting concluded when Dr. Gray spoke to the group about some of the issues raised at the meeting. </p>

<h3><strong>2020-21 Special Education Council Recaps</strong></h3>
<p><strong>April 13:</strong> At the fourth and final meeting of the Superintendent’s Special Education Council meeting, AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, opened the meeting and welcomed the group. He then introduced Paulette Fairchild, who was recently hired as the Director of IDEA, to lead the group in a team building activity.</p>
<p>Then, Judy Weekley and Pam Allen, IEP Coordinators, led focus groups to discuss the process of IEP’s, and how we utilize those meetings to ensure students with an identified disability receive specialized instruction and services. As with many of our services, the pandemic and inability to meet with families in person presented unique challenges to the IEP meetings. Our special education employees have had to go above and beyond to communicate with virtual families using alternative methods, such as virtual meetings and phone calls. During the focus groups, we learned of some effective strategies being implemented that supportIEP compliance. From this discussion, the district will work to incorporate these strategies into the IEP process to ensure they are consistently and appropriately applied.</p>
<p>Next, Darvell Edwards, Executive Director of Special Programs, and Terri Trahan, Executive Director of Compliance and Pupil Appraisal, presented to the group the Expulsion Hearing/Manifestation Determination Review (MDR) Process.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, Superintendent Dr. James Gray thanked the group for their time and invaluable insight. He summed up the importance of these councils in two ways: (1) they provide a lens into the work we’re doing at the district level, and (2) the insights gained truly help to shape the work we do.</p>
<p><strong>February 11:</strong> At the third Superintendent’s Special Education Council meeting, AJ Pethe, Chief of Schools, opened the meeting with an <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/99080962"">inspirational video</a> and team building activity on the importance of shared leadership. When geese fly in formation, their flight range is extended by 77%. Similarly, when we tackle hard tasks together and embrace interdependence, we are more effective and can better support our students, teachers and support employees.</p>
<p>Council members then participated in a focus group discussion centered around virtual learning and curriculum. The insights gleaned from the Focus Group will be shared with the Teaching &amp; Learning department to improve instruction. Focus group questions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the biggest challenge to virtual learning for their children?</li>
<li>How can the district support all stakeholders in helping children to be successful virtually?</li>
<li>What is the biggest challenge for them in relation to curriculum?</li>
<li>What would Tier 1 curriculum support for all stakeholders look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>The general consensus from the Council is that virtual learning would benefit from additional technology and support for teachers, flexibility for families, and an understanding/nurturing approach to help students stay positive and engaged. Insights gleaned from the Focus Group will be shared with the Teaching &amp; Learning department to improve instruction. </p>
<p>Germaine Gilson, Chief of District Affairs, led a discussion focused on the 2021-22 academic calendar. First and foremost, we want to develop a calendar that is student, teacher and family centered. Listed below are some other points taken into consideration when creating the Academic Calendar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the summer learning slide </li>
<li>Provides frequent breaks, while eliminating mid-week breaks to the extent possible </li>
<li>Provide opportunities for district professional development</li>
<li>Adheres to the required 63,720 instructional minutes</li>
<li>Honors the 183 teacher contract days</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council discussed factors that can impact the calendar, including Parent/Teacher conferences. With the increased use of technology, the group would like to see Parent/Teacher meetings spread throughout the week to aid scheduling. Additionally, there is an opportunity to incorporate intersession days to offer targeted interventions for students and professional development for teachers. Following the meeting, the group provided formal feedback on the 2021-22 Academic Calendar to be considered by the calendar committee.</p>
<p>Dr. Gray ended the meeting by addressing the group with an update on District and State initiatives.  Recently, the Louisiana Department of Education released its <a href=""https://www.louisianabelieves.com/resources/about-us/believe-to-achieve"">Believe to Achieve</a> educational priorities. This plan aligns closely with the goals we have set forth as a District in <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/domain/136"">2024: The Future Our Kids Deserve</a>. Dr. Gray also drilled home on the importance of our <a href=""https://www.jpschools.org/Page/332"">Career and Technical Education</a> programs to ensure students graduate career and college ready. </p>
<p><strong>December 17:</strong> The second meeting of the Superintendent’s Special Education Council focused on impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We know this year has been challenging for everyone, and there is a critical need for additional student support. </p>
<p>Edna Metcalf, Executive Director of Health and Human Services led a discussion on mental health and how we can better support students. Some of the suggestions made by the group included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build in breathing exercises </li>
<li>Make sure we’re catching potential issues through preventative services </li>
<li>Above all, ensure we are allowing students to learn through difficult times</li>
<li>Provide support that addresses individual needs and are age appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, Monique Soignet, Director of Family and Social Services, gave an overview of the current mental health services offered by Jefferson Parish Schools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>School-based mental health services, groups and individual counseling</li>
<li>School-based health centers at designated schools</li>
<li>Trauma-informed social workers and SPED social workers at designated schools</li>
<li>Trauma informed training </li>
<li>Universal screening to support all students</li>
<li>Mental Health leadership team</li>
</ul>
<p>The District also presented an overview of the COVID-19 Impact Services and Support. </p>
<p><strong>November 11: </strong>At the first Superintendent’s Special Education Council meeting of the year, members laid the groundwork to help set the agenda for future meetings. Following a get to know you session with Superintendent Dr. James Gray, members discussed the big picture of what's working and what could be improved in regards to special education. The implications of virtual learning was a common theme, and the group felt there were both advantages and challenges with this instructional model. Summarized below are some of the challenges and successes of virtual learning noted by the group.  </p>
<p><b>Successes of Virtual Instruction</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminated social pressures and decreased bullying </li>
<li>Creation of a sustainable “technology structure”</li>
<li>Increased independence with student-driven learning</li>

<h1>Past Superintendent's Student Leadership Councils</h1>



<a href=""/#"">INTERNAL LINK Expand All</a>

<h1>2021-22 Student Leadership Council </h1>

<p><strong>April 4: </strong>The final Superintendent’s Student Council meeting began with a warm welcome from Germaine Gilson, Chief of District Affairs. Followed by her introduction, Gilson introduced Superintendent Dr. James Gray. Dr. Gray opened with applauding the students on prioritizing helping others by taking the initiative to do a community service project during their last meeting. He also thanked them for their contributions and input during their council meetings and expressed the importance of uplifting others. “The point of these councils is to be able to have two-way communication with everyone,” he said “If you ever want to be a great person and great leader, it’s important to learn to build other people up and not just yourselves. I’m proud to see that you all understand this lesson, as I see this being implemented by you all choosing to invest your time for your meeting by reading to elementary students.” </p>
<p>After Dr. Gray spoke, the students took a tour of Riverdale High School and then participated in a service project by reading to Jefferson Elementary School students.  On behalf of Dr. Gray and the Council, classroom books were donated to Jefferson’s Pre-K classes.  </p>
<p><strong>February 9: </strong>The second Superintendent Student Council meeting began with a welcome from Germaine Gilson, Chief District Affairs Officer, where she introduced Superintendent Student Council member Raine Flatau. Flatau is a student from Thomas Jefferson School where the meeting was held, and she took the time to welcome her fellow student council members to her school.</p>
<p>Following the welcome and introductions was an Ideal School Day activity where the students were divided into groups of four and tasked with creating ideal school day scenarios. One person from each group reported their ideas to the rest of the group. Examples of some responses include: </p>
<ul>
<li>“We want to start the day with a positive bus ride by playing calming music, then begin the school day by stating affirmations.” </li>
<li>“An ideal school would have community circles where students can talk to someone.”</li>
<li>“It would be ideal to have teachers that can help with mental health and arrange student checkups with a teacher after or between exams.” </li>
<li> “ An ideal classroom would be decorative,open, and colorful. Classrooms would also have a meditation section where a student can take a mental break.” </li>
</ul>
<p>Following this activity, the students engaged in an <i>Understanding Mental Health: What Can I Do At My School </i>session hosted by Rochelle Gautheir and Todd Cirillo, the district’s mental health counselors. “Mental health is simply a balance between the mind and the body. Keep that in mind,” said Todd Cirillo. He reviewed the difference between “having the blues'' and being clinically depressed. He explained that depression is manageable and comes through connections and conversation. While situational depression is a circumstance in which depression is more short term. The council separated into groups to discuss ideas to promote mental health awareness. Some of these ideas include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a documentary featuring district students that helps other students see how close to home these issues are and how normal it is to have such feelings</li>
<li>Having adults share their own struggles with mental health, which will create an open discussion with teachers about mental health and show students that adults struggle too.</li>
<li>Normalize mental health by messaging out mental health statistics</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Implementing mental health specific counselors in schools</li>
<li>Arrange for designated times to discuss issues with teachers</li>
<li>Send parents mindful, positive messages </li>
</ul>
<p>The group was then greeted by Dr. Gray where he began his conversation by addressing a comment regarding feeling as though there is a gap in communication between adults and students. “The age gap is not what makes people be able to relate to you; it is a mindset shift. I know many older people who are able to relate to younger people simply because their mindset is open to change. So this is a matter of mindset, rather than age gap. I encourage our teachers to have this mindset as well,” said Dr. Gray.  He also encouraged students to sit down with teachers and have these conversations with them as to how they can tackle many of the social and emotional support that they feel they are lacking.</p>
<p>The group then engaged in a rapid fire session with Dr. Gray where they were given an opportunity to ask questions, make comments, and propose solutions. Each student was asked to write down their question or comment on an index card, where Ms. Gilson would pull a few cards from a fish bowl. A few concerns that were brought to Dr. Gray’s attention included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Providing additional support to students who are still struggling academically </li>
<li>Lack of counselors on school campuses </li>
<li>Need for a designated place on campus to decompress</li>
</ul>
<p>The group then participated in a leadership activity facilitated by Diane Jackson, the Program Director of the Slone Group. The discussion was focused on leadership communication and began with an activity where each student was handed a picture and instructed to place the pictures in chronological order. Once completed, the students were asked what tactics they used in order to accurately place the pictures. Jackson mentioned that the lesson in the activity was to become more comfortable asking for resources, implementing teamwork, communication, and flexibility. Following this activity, the meeting concluded with a tour of  Thomas Jefferson School. </p>
<p><strong>December 15: </strong>The first Superintendent’s Student Council meeting began with Germaine Gilson, Chief District Affairs Officer, instructing the students to describe themselves on a sheet of paper without using their name, ethnicity, school, or age. </p>
<p>“I love history and particular political turmoil. I hope to never stop bettering myself as a person.” </p>
<p>“I'm a leader and student athlete. I am also a proud immigrant and love wearing lipstick on everything.”  </p>
<p>“I'm currently taking dual enrollment classes and plan to have my associate degree by the end of my senior year.” </p>
<p>“I’m known as Madam President. I love indie rock music and am on the cross country team, although I probably would’ve quit if it weren’t for the people on that team. People never really know what I’m going to say next. I hope to join the Peace Corps when I grow up.” </p>
<p>“I am from a small town called Lafitte. My goal in life is to make the world a better place. I love math and can do it all day and every day. I hope to one day become a labor and delivery nurse.” </p>
<p>Ms. Gilson concluded the activity,stating “You are more than just your name, your ethnicity, your age, or even your school. I want you to know who you truly are and realize that there are people in this world who need what you have to offer.”</p>
<p>The students then viewed a presentation by Rochelle Gauthier and Todd Cirillo, two mental health professionals who work with JP Schools to foster positive mental and emotional well-being for students and staff. The students received information about mental health, how to recognize the difference between depression and anxiety, and were taught various exercises that can be used to cope with such experiences. The students then engaged in an activity where they were taught effective ways to cope when encountering feelings of anxiety or depression. “This is an exercise that you can do to bring yourself to the present,” said Ms. Gauthier. </p>
<p>The mental health professionals also explained what depression and anxiety symptoms look like, as well as what separates clinical depression from situational depression. “One in five adolescents have some sort of mental health diagnosis. Depression and anxiety are most common amongst high school students, which is why we want to focus on providing resources for these diagnoses specifically. This is normal and there's nothing wrong with that. We always want to normalize these feelings, because they are in fact normal. With this in mind, our goal is to see how we can be supportive,” said Ms. Gauthier.  </p>
<p>The Superintendent's Student Council spent the remainder of the time engaging with Superintendent Dr. James Gray after he spoke in depth about being in leadership roles for the right reasons and emphasizing how a strong work ethic can open a door to a promising career path. He also spoke a great deal about how important decision-making is as a leader.  Dr. Gray stated, “As a leader, when you are trying to do what's right for the entire population, you must be so grounded in who you are as a person. It’s important to take everyone's well-being into account, and make sound decisions based on what those needs are, all while being sure not to make an emotional decision. As superintendent of Jefferson Parish, I rely on my experience to make sure that you receive a quality education.”</p>

<h3><strong>2020-21 Student Leadership Council Recap</strong></h3>
<p><strong>April 21:</strong> For the fourth and final Superintendent’s Student Council meeting, Germaine Gilson, Chief District Affairs Officer, opened the meeting with appreciation and inspiration for the Student Council members. “You are equipped, you have the skills, you have the support to succeed. Don’t let anything hold you back,” said Ms. Gilson. Ms. Gilson then welcomed several of the senior Student Council members to the stage for a reflection on their experience having spent multiple years in the Council.</p>
<p>“This is not just about learning from each other, but creating action. My proudest moment was that we actually changed the bullying policy.” - Morgan Delatte, Fisher Middle-High</p>
<p>“All three years have been amazing. It has been wonderful to be part of something bigger than myself. I’ve learned that being a good leader is leading even without the recognition or appreciation. Leadership isn’t about popularity.” - Ashley Laws, West Jefferson High</p>
<p>“I made memories with this group that I will never forget, such as meeting Cynthia Lee Sheng before she became Parish President. I have been introduced to people I would have never had access to without this council.” - Juliette Lebouef, L.W. Higgins High</p>
<p>“This Council has given me the opportunity to make a difference and really make a change at my high school. It enabled me to shine a light on how I was feeling and how other students were feeling.” - Kaitlyn Shelton, Thomas Jefferson Academy</p>
<p>Next, Superintendent Dr. Gray spoke to the lasting impact this Council will have. “Being on a team builds a level of camaraderie that can never be broken,” said Dr. Gray. He encouraged the members to stay in touch through the years. As these students progress in their leadership, it will become increasingly important to surround themselves with intelligent, sensible people. “Surround yourself with people who have different opinions from you to help you consider all impacts of a decision,” said Dr. Gray. Being a leader is not about making the popular decision, it’s about making the right decision. The network they are building is invaluable to inform their decision making for years to come.</p>
<p>The Council then engaged in a presentation on servant leadership with Dr. Shondra Williams, CEO of InclusivCare. She emphasized that servant leadership is not about the person with the highest title in the room, it is about the people doing the work. “I really think that at the end of the day it is not about me. It is about you,” said Dr. Williams. Every member on the team is equally important and worth celebrating. She illustrated this through a group activity to identify who in the room completed the most service hours during the year. Then, she presented the same prize to the student who completed the least amount of hours as the student who completed the most hours because both students tried their best.</p>
<p>Dr. Williams also reflected on the pandemic and how it forced all of us to recognize the leaders within. Many of us had to make sacrifices and were faced with difficult decisions. Despite the challenges of the last year, the lessons we’ve learned have equipped us for the road ahead.</p>
<p>The Superintendent’s Student Council spent the remainder of the meeting reviewing a proposed high school Counselor Profile for the district. In previous Council meetings, the group participated in discussions about their school counselor experience and provided informal and formal feedback via a counselor survey. Based on that insight, the group helped to create a Counselor Profile that will be shared with all high school counselors in the district to guide their work. This guiding document is just one way the Council has contributed to real decisions and policy-making at the district level.</p>
<p><strong>February 10:</strong> During the third Superintendent’s Student Council meeting, Dr. Gray began with a discussion on servant leadership. Servant leadership puts the priorities of the people you serve into your work and all of your decision-making. Through student and teacher feedback, direct engagement and these Council meetings, we are able to hear stakeholder priorities and needs. Then, we can bring that knowledge into our shared decision-making. Dr. Gray emphasized that servant leaders put the needs of others before their own. Given the mental strains of this year, now more than ever, it is critical to support the needs of those around us. Sometimes, the right decision isn’t the most popular decision. Still, a servant leader pushes forward with the work that benefits those s/he serves.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the group heard presentations from two local non-profits: Second Harvest Food Bank and Jefferson Dollars for Scholars. Second Harvest is the largest food bank in Louisiana and provided more than 50 million meals in 2020, double what they provide in a typical year. Louisiana has one of the highest food insecurity rates in the country, and one in four Louisiana children are food insecure. Since the start of the pandemic, food insecurity has skyrocketed by 30%. Students were encouraged to consider programs, like Second Harvest when developing their service projects.</p>
<p>Jefferson Parish Dollars for Scholars has awarded scholarships surpassing $29 million to more than 5,800 Jefferson Parish students. While the organization distributes funds for academic enrichment programs, ACT and National Merit preparation, the majority of its funding is dedicated to college scholarships. The premise of Dollars for Scholars is that if everyone in the community gave $1, local students would be able to go to college.</p>
<p>The students also spent time discussing school counseling services as a follow-up to the last Council meeting. The feedback received from our Superintendent’s Council meetings will be used to inform and improve our processes as a district and contribute to shared decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>December 16:</strong> The second Student Leadership Council meeting kicked off with a review of counseling services available on campus. As high school students prepare for graduation and college, it is important that they have regular interaction with counselors to prepare them for and help guide them through the admissions process. It was clear that one of the best ways to drive college attendance is through education on the college application process. Following the discussion, an admissions counselor from the University of New Orleans gave a presentation on academic life.</p>
<p>Germaine Gilson introduced Dr. Gray and moderated an open conversation centered around the Principles of Leadership. Some of Dr. Gray’s words of advice included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you start to make money, always pay yourself first.</li>
<li>Hold true to your core tenets. Never compromise who you are as a person.</li>
<li>You have to take care of your health</li>
<li>Life is a pendulum, sometimes you will spend more time working and sometimes you will spend more time with family. Strive for work life balance.</li>
<li>Your time is the most valuable thing you can give. That is how you will generate the outcomes you desire. Money fixes a short-term need. Time will have a long term impact</li>
</ul>
<p>The students spent the remainder of the meeting planning for their service projects and incorporating what they learned about leadership into actionable next steps.</p>
<p><strong>November 10:</strong> Students are at the center of everything we do in Jefferson Parish Schools. Thus, it’s important that we bring our students to the table and get their unique perspectives on how we can improve our schools. At the first Superintendent’s Student Council meeting of the year, members discussed leadership and how to be a positive influencer on campus. Students broke into small groups to work through sample challenges they may face at school, and how they can shift the situation to be a positive experience for their peers.</p>
<p>After giving students insight into his personal background and career path, Dr. Gray sat for a Q&amp;A session with the members, answering questions that range from “how do we keep everyone safe during the pandemic” and if he prefers to read a book or watch TV to unwind in the evenings. This provided an opportunity for students to find their voice in a safe environment. Students also walked away with new friendships across the district and ideas to bring back to their schools to increase school spirit and strengthen a positive school culture.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, students laid the groundwork to set the agenda for future meetings. Below is a recap of topics the Student council would like to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating opportunities for others to become involved in the success of our school</li>
<li>Leading the culminating service project on campus</li>
<li>Leadership and how to be a positive influencer</li>
<li>Supporting students with virtual learning</li>
</ul>
<p>The Superintendent’s Council meetings provide valuable insights to inform and improve our decisions at the district level. We will continue to share these recaps with you to ensure we are all working towards our shared goal of delivering the best outcomes for the students of Jefferson Parish.</p>

<h1>2021-22 Teacher Council </h1>

<p><strong>April 4: </strong>The final Superintendent’s Teacher Council meeting began with Laura Roussel, Chief Academic Officer, welcoming the teachers to their last council meeting and sharing how proud she was of all that the group accomplished. Roussel explained that the focus of the final meeting would be on the significance of culture within a school, how teachers are the foundation of their school’s culture, and how teachers can lead by influence. “Human capital in education is more valuable than anything we can buy,” said Roussel. “Human capital is critical. Leaders have just as much impact on students as teachers.” </p>
<p>Following her remarks, Roussel further explained that any teacher can be a leader and influence the culture within a school. Roussel then introduced the program “Operation Lead” and explained that the program would consist of a six-week curriculum designed to encourage leaders to understand the context behind what they do. Following the program introduction, the teachers were tasked to turn to the person next to them and discuss what attributes of school leadership they believe are critical for teachers to have an impact on student achievement. Answers provided were: </p>
<ul>
<li>Positive atmosphere</li>
<li>Open communication </li>
<li>Solution-oriented opportunities</li>
<li>Consistency </li>
<li>School-wide behavior expectations for students</li>
<li>Understanding challenges </li>
<li>Failure is OK as we try new things. </li>
<li>Lead, learn, or mentor </li>
<li>Visibility for support </li>
<li>Community engagement </li>
<li>Feedback </li>
<li>A learner’s attitude </li>
</ul>
<p>Following the group activity, Superintendent Dr. James Gray addressed the council members by applauding the teachers for their everyday work. Gray also spoke in-depth about how much influence a teacher has on a student’s life, and the importance of  promoting the profession as the rewarding work that it is. “What do we need to do to protect our own profession and mental health, while also still investing in our students?” asked Dr. Gray. Following his remarks, Gray took a few questions from teachers before answering rapid fire questions presented by each of the council members. A few of the questions were: </p>
<ul>
<li>Can you provide a timeline of when the district will receive approval for in-house teacher certification? </li>
<li>How would that look for someone who is already in the certification program?</li>
<li>Will there be an opportunity to train some of the teachers for add-on certifications? </li>
<li>What are we doing to address the shortage of special education teachers? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since the recent vote on the calendar, is there any progress on stopping at the same time at the end of the school year? </li>
<li>Is there a possibility of providing reduced or free after-school care for employees' children? </li>
<li>Is there anything you can say about the Spanish-speaking social worker shortage? </li>
<li>Are school start times changing for the 2022-23 school year? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February 9:</strong> The Superintendent's Teacher Council was led by Laura Roussel, Chief Academic Officer.. The meeting began with an ice breaker bingo to help participants get to know one another better.</p>
<p>The group then took a deep dive into Student Learning Targets (SLT), since it had been a concern brought up by the council at a previous meeting. Roussel emphasized the  importance of understanding the purpose or intent of  SLT’s, rather than focusing on  the notion that SLT’s are overwhelming due to policies and accountability. She further explained three big ideas that help to keep the purpose of SLTs at the forefront: <strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Teaching implies learning.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Student learning is at the forefront . </b></li>
<li><b>Equity and Equality -  Every student should have access to rigorous goals for learning. </b></li>
</ul>
<p>The council group was then tasked to think about what messages could be beneficial for teachers to hear so that the purpose of SLT’s can be better understood and more widely accepted. The council members were separated into groups of two, where they were instructed to communicate what would be helpful for a teacher to hear about SLT’s given the newfound perspective and purpose regarding Student Learning Targets. Examples of these messages were shared with Roussel separately amongst each individual group. Roussel asked the council to serve on a special committee to review SLT guidance. </p>
<p>Following the exercise, the teachers were greeted by Dr. Gray when he emphasized the importance of their participation in this council. “More than anything, this is an opportunity for me to hear from you and about what concerns you are facing,” said Dr. Gray. He then touched on mental and social awareness issues and assured the council members that the district has plans underway to combat those concerns amongst teachers. </p>
<p>The meeting concluded with an opportunity to suggest changes and raise concerns to Dr. Gray. The topics mentioned included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of clarity with SLT’s; not knowing the “why” </li>
<li>Overly generalized SLT guidance </li>
<li>The return of field trips</li>
<li>Opportunities for more professional development </li>
<li>Better communication to be kept abreast on what changes are being made </li>
<li>Social and Emotional support from staff shortages </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>December 15:</strong> The Superintendent’s Teacher Council began with an icebreaker led by Laura Roussel, Chief Academic Officer, where teachers were asked to introduce themselves, state what school they teach, and share a fun fact about themselves. </p>
<p>Following the icebreaker exercise, the Superintendent's Teacher Council was greeted by Superintendent Dr. James Gray, where he shared his personal story. Dr. Gray explained that it was his teachers rather than his parents who encouraged him to further his education by planting the seed that he could attend college for free through a basketball scholarship. Dr. Gray said, “It was my teachers that nurtured me and made sure that I fared well. Even my first dress jacket came from my high school basketball coach.” Dr. Gray also shared that attending college at Grambling University put him on the right path, which was ultimately a stepping stone to a promising career. </p>
<p>After hearing Dr. Gray’s story, the teachers brainstormed a list of topics that the council could spend time discussing at the following meetings. One teacher made a poignant remark that seemed to resonate with both Dr. Gray and other teachers in the room, noting “For our students, I think that it's important that we <i>vision cast</i> for them so that they can both visualize and internalize their goals.” Both Ms. Roussel and Dr. Gray noted how remarkable they found the phrase “vision cast,” and expressed their appreciation for this insight, further mentioning that this idea was heavily noted. </p>
<p>The Superintendent’s Teacher Council concluded with what is referred to as a “ rapid fire,” a session in which teachers share their primary concerns. Below are the topics shared: </p>
<ul>
<li>ELL support</li>
<li>SPED support and inclusion model</li>
<li>SLTs</li>
<li>School culture </li>
<li>Utilizing paraprofessionals more effectively</li>
<li>Teacher shortage</li>
<li>Building joy back into the school day</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Transition to the new Social Studies standards</li>
<li>Utilizing technology to best support teaching and learning</li>
<li>Adjusting the Academic Calendar </li>
<li>Supporting programs like hotel and coding certifications in Spanish </li>
<li>More communication about the importance of library and an allocated budget for libraries </li>
<li>Transparent and open dialogue with principals to understand perspectives </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2020-21 Teacher Council Recap</strong></h3>
<p><strong>April 14:</strong> At the fourth and final meeting of the Superintendent’s Teacher’s Council meeting, Gabrielle Misfeldt, Chief of Staff, opened the meeting with an icebreaker discussing things our educators gained personally and professionally during the pandemic that they plan to continue. Some of our teachers touted becoming experts at tutorial videos and using online learning apps, while others talked about small ways to connect and engage their students on a daily basis. While this year has been challenging, each and everyone of us has gained something, taken up a new hobby or habit and grown in a positive way. It’s important we recognize those skills that will help us transition from this pandemic stronger than before.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the meeting was to preview and garner feedback on our summer learning programs. Laura Roussel, Chief Academic Officer, presented on the Jefferson Summer Learning Program and how it will provide students with additional opportunities for accelerated learning and enrichment during the summer months. She emphasized that it will be accelerated learning to focus on upcoming skills and create a strong bridge to the upcoming year as opposed to remediation, which covers content from the previous year. The 2021 summer program will be expanded in duration, attendance and content to address learning loss resulting from pandemic learning. Goals for the program include:</p>
<p>Prepare students for the next school year and accelerate any learning gaps in Math and ELA<br/>Partner with local and national organizations to offer enrichment activities that foster joy and engagement and develop the whole child<br/>Safely interact with peers in-person and build a sense of community<br/>The teachers provided genuine feedback on how to create an inclusive program that accelerates all feedback. Overall, the program was well-received and the group identified several opportunities to make the program attractive and effective for both students and educators.</p>
<p>Superintendent Dr. James Gray closed out the meeting with his appreciation for the Teacher’s Council. “We completely support you, and we will do everything in our power to help you be successful,” said Dr. Gray. During his first year as Superintendent, these councils have provided an opportunity for the community to get to know him and the work we’re doing at the district level while, in turn, providing a forum for two-dialogue to shape our work.</p>
<p><strong>February 10:</strong> At the previous Superintendent’s Teacher Council meeting, we heard that teachers feel pressure from the different district and school mandates. We narrowed in on that topic during the third Superintendent’s Teacher Council meeting. Council members participated in a consensus placement activity to identify the top three mandates placed on teachers. </p>
<p>Germain Gilson, Chief of District Affairs, led a discussion on the creation of the academic calendar. First and foremost, we want to develop a calendar that is student, teacher and family centered. Listed below are some other points taken into consideration when creating the Academic Calendar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the summer learning slide</li>
<li>Provides frequent breaks, while eliminating mid-week breaks to the extent possible </li>
<li>Provide opportunities for district professional development</li>
<li>Adheres to the required 63,720 instructional minutes</li>
<li>Honors the 183 teacher contract days</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council members had ideas and suggestions for how the District can enhance teacher professional development days through differentiation, placement and instruction. Following the meeting, the group provided formal feedback on the 2021-22 Academic Calendar to be considered by the calendar committee.</p>
<p>Additionally, Council members brought forth questions and challenges during a Rapid Fire Q&amp;A session led by Superintendent Dr. James Gray and Laura Roussell, Chief Academic Officer. The District will use the feedback provided from the mandate discussion and Rapid Fire session to identify areas where we can alleviate pressure points for teachers while continuing to deliver the best results for students.</p>
<p><strong>December 16:</strong> The focus for the second meeting of the Superintendent’s Teacher Council was how we can better support effective instruction of both in-person and virtual learners. To begin the conversation, the group reviewed the critical factors taken into consideration when Virtual Jefferson was developed. Offering a choice of instructional models for families has always been an important tenet of Start Strong Jefferson. Due to the overwhelming registration in Virtual Jefferson at the beginning of the year, adjustments had to be made and instruction needed to be tailored to accommodate both at-home and in-person learners.</p>
<p>The Council brought several suggestions for the administration to take into consideration, some of which are already being implemented. The conversations centered around classroom management, understanding of technology, Google products and student engagement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Council voiced some concerns and challenges they continue to experience with virtual learning including lack of accountability for virtual learners and challenges with planning when students are frequently switching between virtual and in-person.</p>
<p>Following the discussion on virtual learning, the Council directed rapid fire questions to Superintendent Dr. James Gray dealing with teacher burnout and mental health, district mandates, COVID-19 notification and quarantine protocols, ESL learners and assessments.</p>
<p>The feedback received from these Council meetings is critical to helping to inform and improve our operations as a school district. We appreciate the engagement shown by all of our teachers as we work together to build a more successful school system.</p>
<p><strong>November 10:</strong> At the first Superintendent’s Teacher Council meeting of the year on November 10, 2020, members laid the groundwork and set the agenda for future meetings. Following an icebreaker activity, the group established norms for how we will work together to accomplish objectives for the council. These norms included honesty, empathy, listening to understand, and equity among the voices heard. We discussed how creating a safe space where teachers feel comfortable sharing their honest opinions ensures we can accurately  capture the issues and move forward in resolving them. While the group is diverse in their positions and opinions on different issues, it is unanimous that everyone in the group wants the best for the students of Jefferson Parish. Each member brings with them a unique experience and perspective to help achieve our common goal. </p>
<p>For some, this was their first time having candid conversations with Dr. Gray in his new role as Superintendent. He gave the group insight into his personal and professional background to help everyone understand his approach to district-level decisions. Dr. Gray emphasized the importance to understanding the why - why he pursued a career in education, why he cares deeply about our teachers and students, and why he will always put our students first. He recognized that these are challenging times and that the situation asks a lot of our educators. However, it’s important that we stay motivated and find our cheerleader. When we approach this difficult work with a positive mindset, it puts us all in a better position to be successful.   </p>
<p>Following an open conversation with Dr. Gray, the group outlined the topics they would like to tackle over the next three meetings. We are sharing this list to be transparent with all of our teachers.</p>

<li>Options/opportunities for less dual teaching of both in-person and virtual students – do one or the other if possible</li>
<li>Timeline for some Start Strong protocols to shift (e.g. when teachers can stay in rooms and kids shift)</li>
<li>Supporting families with technology and virtual learning</li>
<li>Teachers’ emotional and mental health</li>
<li>Bridging the divide between schools and district office</li>
<li>Responding to needs of ELL learners and supporting teachers to better support ELL learners and families</li>

<li>Differentiating support for students AND teachers</li>
<li>Ensuring teacher voice into school AND district decisions</li>

<p>In Jefferson Parish Schools, we have students about 40 hours a week. For all kids to succeed, they need strong community partners for the other 128 hours. It complements the work already taking place to improve outcomes for all students and make JP Schools one of the most improved districts in the state.</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<h3><strong>Compulsory School Attendance/Compulsory Ages/Duty of Parent-Legal Guardian/Consent to Withdraw</strong></h3>
<p>In compliance with the Louisiana Revised Statute 17:221, the policy of Jefferson Parish Schools requires that every parent/legal guardian residing within Jefferson Parish, having control or charge of any child from that child’s seventh (7th) birthday until his/her eighteenth (18th) birthday, shall send such child to a public or private day school, or have him/her enrolled in an approved home study program, unless the child graduates from high school prior to his/her eighteenth (18) birthday. Any child below the age of seven (7) who legally enrolls in school shall also be subject to compulsory attendance provisions. Every parent/legal guardian responsible for sending a child to a public or private day school under provisions of this section shall also assure the attendance of such child in regularly assigned classes during regular school hours established by the School Board. </p>
<p>Marriage of minors under the age of eighteen (18) years results in their emancipation; hence there is no person in charge or control of them and no method or procedure by which their attendance in school can be compelled.</p>

<h3><strong>Types of Absences</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>Exempted and Excused</strong>: The student is allowed to make up missed work and the absence is not counted against attendance requirements. Examples are extended illness, court, death in immediate family, or religious holidays with proper verification. </p>
<h3><strong>B.</strong> <strong>Non-Exempted and Excused</strong>: Absences incurred due to personal illness documented by parental notes. The student is allowed to make up missed work and absences are considered when determining whether the student meets attendance requirements. </h3>
<h3><strong>C.</strong> <strong>Unexcused</strong>: The student is not allowed to miss work and the absence is counted against the attendance requirement. An example is skipping school </h3>
<h3><strong>D.</strong> <strong>Out of school suspensions</strong>: The student is allowed to make up missed work but the absence is counted against the attendance requirement. (not for truancy purposes) </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Absence Procedures</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Excuses for all absences must be presented in writing to the school principal or designee within five (5) days of the absence. </li>
<li>For any extenuating circumstances, the student’s parent or legal guardian must make a formal appeal to the Compliance Office requesting exception to the attendance regulation. Students who are verified as meeting extenuating circumstances, and therefore eligible to receive grades, shall not receive grades if they are unable to complete make-up work or pass the course. </li>
<li>Schools are to provide students and parents with attendance letters by the 3rd, 5th, and 8th day absent. Parents must contact the school principal or school counselor to discuss attendance matters upon receipt of attendance letters.  </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Elementary/Middle Schools:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>According to the policy of the state of Louisiana, students must attend elementary or middle school for a total of 60,120 minutes to<br/>be eligible for promotion. Based on the school calendar and a standard 375 minute instructional day, a student can miss no more than<br/>14 days of school to be eligible for promotion.</p>
<p><strong>High School Students:</strong></p>
<p>In order to receive grades for a semester/year, high school students must be in attendance for a minimum of 30,060 minutes in a semester or 60,120 minutes in a year for schools not operating on a semester system.</p>
<p>Based on a standard 360 minute instructional day, this means that students in a high school on a semester system can miss no more than 7 days in the 90-day first semester and 7 days in the 93-day second semester. Students in schools not on a semester system can miss no more than 14 days to be eligible for promotion Carnegie units based on minutes.</p>

<h4><strong>Attendance Requirements - Carnegie Credit</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to meeting overall attendance requirements, middle and high school students must also meet certain attendance requirements to receive Carnegie Credit for individual classes.</p>
<p>In order to earn one Carnegie Credit, students must be in attendance in a specific course for 7,515 minutes. The length of periods and courses varies by school, but as an illustration, if a school is on a 4X4 block schedule and has courses that are 90 minutes long, a student must attend at least 84 classes (7,515 divided by 90). If there were 89 course meetings, the student could miss a maximum of 7 course meetings (89-84) and still receive credit. For middle school students to earn Carnegie Credits, the same standards apply.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The charter schools department is a part of the Jefferson Parish Public School System.</p>
<p>The mission of the charter schools team is to increase the number of high-quality schools available to students and families in Jefferson Parish. The charter schools team specifically focuses on empowering and holding accountable charter schools, publicly-funded schools that are run independently of the school district.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The charter schools team serves several roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selecting and authorizing new charter schools.</strong> The charter schools team selects new schools from those that apply to Jefferson Parish based on the needs of the community and the quality of applications.</li>
<li><strong>Holding charter schools accountable for student success.</strong> Charter schools have greater accountability than traditional public schools because they operate on performance-based contracts. The charter schools team sets clear expectations for school performance, provides ongoing feedback to charter schools during the year, and finally assesses charter schools against the criteria for success. Holding schools accountable also means closing schools that are not helping all students achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Helping families find the best school.</strong> The charter schools team helps families learn about charter schools in Jefferson Parish and find the school option that is best for their students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Charter School?</h2>
<p>Open-enrollment charter schools are free public schools that have the flexibility to adapt to the educational needs of individual students. Open-enrollment charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students with different needs and interests. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools.</p>
<p>Just like traditional public schools, charter schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students, and operate under and receive accountability ratings from the Louisiana Department of Education. Both charter and traditional public school students take the LEAP test. Charter schools in Jefferson Parish are authorized by the Jefferson Parish School Board to provide additional high-quality options to Jefferson Parish families and students.</p>
<p>Charter school leaders make decisions that are mission-driven and centered on the needs of the students in that school. They include choices concerning mission, curriculum, professional development, report card formats, and hiring. Families can choose charter schools based on their mission, their academic performance, their school culture, or even their location; prospective students are not required to attend the neighborhood district school.</p>
<p>To learn more about charter schools in Louisiana, visit the <a href=""http://lacharterschools.org/"">Louisiana Association of Public Charter Schools</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Helpful Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any child eligible to attend public school in Jefferson Parish is also eligible to attend the district’s charter schools. Charter schools cannot discriminate based on race, gender, or achievement measures.</li>
<li>If the number of interested students for a charter school exceeds the number of available seats, the school will conduct a lottery to randomly select students to admit.</li>
<li>If you are interested in applying to any charter school, you should contact the school directly for information about the application and enrollment timeline and process. Most of the charter schools in Jefferson Parish run their application process early in the calendar year.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>It is the policy of Jefferson Parish Schools that discipline be defined as essential to the orderly operation of any school and the maintenance of an environment conducive to quality education. Discipline is behavior in accord with rules of conduct. A student is required to conduct himself/herself properly while under school supervision and to comply with all policies and regulations declared to govern pupil conduct. Each student shall be held strictly accountable for any disorderly conduct in school buildings, on school premises, on school buses, and at school-sanctioned events. Any violations of the code of conduct should be reported to the school administration.</p>
<p>Any violation of a code of conduct article may result in disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>Detention</h2>
<p>Before or after-school detentions of an hour or less or Saturday detentions may be assigned either by the teacher or administrator. The parent/legal guardian is notified by means of a detention notice at least one (1) day before the detention is to be served. Two (2) copies of the detention notice will be sent home with the student. One (1) copy is to be retained by the parent/legal guardian. One (1) copy should be signed by the parent/legal guardian and returned to school before the detention is to be served. The parent/legal guardian can legally refuse to allow the student to serve detentions. However, the student will be subject to suspension from school.</p>

<h2>In-School Suspension</h2>
<p>ISS allows students to remain under the school’s supervision during the suspension, to receive counseling related to specific behaviors, and to work on academic skills by completing assignments and/or general academic packets. After successfully completing the ISS, the student may return to the regular school/schedule and will be eligible to complete all missed assignments. The absence(s), according to state guidelines, is an excused absence.</p>
<h2>Out-of-School Suspension</h2>
<p>OSS removes student from the campus for a period not to exceed 10 consecutive school days. The student may return to the regular school after a conference is held with school administration and the parent or guardian and the time assigned has been completed. The student is eligible to complete all missed assignments and the absence(s), according to state guidelines, is a non-exempted absence.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is part of the District Affairs Unit of the Jefferson Parish  Schools.</li>
<li>Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports provides an operational framework for improving student academic and behavior outcomes.</li>
<li>It ensures all students have access to the most effective and accurately implemented instructional and behavioral practices and interventions.</li>
<li>PBIS is NOT a curriculum, but IS a decision-making framework that guides selection, integration and implementation of the best evidence-based academic and behavioral practices for improving academic and behavioral outcomes for all students.</li>
<li>The basic PBIS approach is to use proactive, research-based strategies to teach clearly defined behavioral expectations.</li>
<li>It establishes ongoing behavior supports that can be used by ALL students, staff, parents, volunteers, and community members.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does PBIS Work?</h2>
<p>Research shows that when a school environment is positive and predictable, students feel safe, have better academic performance, higher test results and make better behavior choices. Schools also show a gain in instructional time and a reduction in discipline referrals and out of school suspensions.</p>
<h2>PBIS in JP Schools</h2>
<p>JPS has a PBIS District Coordinator that coordinates trainings, supports schools, and serves as a liaison between the district and the LDOE. Each school in JPS has a Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports Team comprised of a team leader, an administrator, faculty and staff members representing various grade levels and departments of the school, and support personnel.</p>
<h2><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Schools will be reimbursed for subs for all trainings offered through Region 1 Consortium funds when attending during school hours. </h2>

<h2>Vector Training - (Previously Safe Schools)</h2>
<p>Click <a href=""https://jppss-la.safeschools.com/login"">here</a> to access the Vector Training site. The following courses are recommended for all School Employees who work directly with students. Employees will use their seven digit employee number as their user ID. No password is required.

<p>For Pre-Tax deductions, once you elect an insurance option, you can only change that option during the Annual Enrollment or Open Enrollment period unless you meet a qualifying event/family status change.  You must contact the JP Schools Insurance Team and complete the benefit change within thirty (30) calendar days of the qualifying event or family status change. Qualifying events/family status changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting married, divorced, or legally separated</li>
<li>Birth, adoption, or placement of adoption of an eligible child</li>
<li>Death of your covered spouse or child</li>
<li>Change in your or your spouse’s work status that affects benefits eligibility (for example: starting a new job or leaving a job)</li>
<li>A change in your child’s eligibility for benefits</li>
<li>Becoming eligible for Medicare or Medicaid</li>
<li>A significant change in your spouse’s health coverage attributable to your spouse’s employment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Newborns and Adopted Children to Insurance Coverage</h2>
<ul>
<li>To add a newborn as a dependent on your medical insurance coverage, you must provide the JP Schools insurance department with a birth certificate or a copy of the birth letter within 30 days of the child’s birth date. The birth letter will suffice as proof of parentage only if it contains the relationship of the child to the JP Schools employee with the medical insurance. If the birth certificate or birth letter is not received within 30 days, the child cannot be added until the next annual enrollment period. To schedule an appointment with the JP Schools Insurance team, please call 504-349-8564.</li>
<li>To add an adopted child, you must provide the insurance department with legal adoption papers within 30 days of the child’s adoption date. To add a child placed for adoption with you, you must provide the insurance department with the adoption placement agreement or an act of surrender and Clerk of Court certification in compliance with La.R.S. 22:1004 within 30 days of the child’s placement for adoption with you. If these legal adoption papers are not received within the 30-day timeframe, enrollment cannot take place until the next annual enrollment period, unless you experience another qualified life event that supports the addition of the child to the plan. To schedule an appointment with the JPPSS insurance team, please call 504-349-8564.</li>
<li>While OGB will need the social security card for every person on the plan, the social security card is not a requirement for initial enrollment for a newborn or adopted/placed child.  Please remember to send the JPPSS insurance department the social security card upon receipt, preferably within 90 days of the birth/adoption.</li>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p><strong>Why am I being evaluated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JP Schools performance evaluations are designed to provide all employees with increased opportunities for professional growth and development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does the evaluation process begin?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Employees meet with their immediate supervisor, to complete the Beginning of the Year: Goal Setting Form. The form sets the goals, performance indicators and expectations that Support Employees will be evaluated on throughout the school year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How often do I get evaluated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Employees are not formally evaluated until the end of the school year. During the End of Year Evaluation, each Support Employee will receive a score for each competency, performance indicator and goal.
<ul>
<li>After the completion of the Beginning of the Year: Goal Setting Form, your immediate supervisor may conduct observations and give feedback throughout the school year, leading up to the formal evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who is required to receive an evaluation?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>What if I do not sign the End of Year Evaluation Form?</strong></p>
<ul>

<p>Eligible employees who desire to participate in the VTP are <strong><u>required</u> </strong>to complete an Internal Application /Transfer Form online during the application window (March 1- May 31, 2022).</p>

<h1>Legal</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>As Chief Legal Counsel for Jefferson Parish Schools, Patricia A. Adams, J.D., advises the Superintendent, Department Heads and school-based administrators on a wide variety of legal matters that arise in the K through 12 educational environment.</p>
<p>Representative legal matters include all aspects of the employment relationship, from recruitment and hiring to employee discipline and separation, employee grievances, employee benefits and employee rights under Title VII, Title IX, ADEA, ADA, FMLA and corresponding state law.</p>
<p>Typical school law matters include student rights and responsibilities under state and federal law and Board policy, constitutional issues of free speech, search and seizure and student discipline, special education under the IDEA and Section 504, and student confidentiality and privacy under FERPA and La. R.S. 17:3914.</p>
<p>Ms. Adams represents the district before state and federal administrative agencies, oversees the district’s response to requests for records, including requests for public records under the Louisiana Public Records Act (La. R.S. 44:1, et seq.), and is responsible for the drafting, review and revision of contracts and district policies.</p>
<h2>Public Record Request</h2>
<p><a href=""/Page/3224"">INTERNAL LINK Make a Public Record Request</a></p>
<p>Anyone eighteen (18) years of age or older may make a request for public records.  The requester is entitled to inspect or obtain a copy of a public record produced by, or in the possession of, a public entity.  The right to make such a request is granted by the State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Public Records Act, La. R.S. 44:1, et seq., and Article 3, Section 3 of the Louisiana Constitution.</p>
<p>Public records are documents that are prepared, possessed, used or retained for use by a public body in the conduct, performance or transaction of public business, regardless of the physical form or characteristics, and including information in electronic format.</p>
<p>Not all records are subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act.  Some records are expressly exempt from disclosure under the Act, while others may be withheld where there is a recognized constitutional right, such as the right to privacy under Art. I, Section 5 of the Louisiana Constitution.  Examples of the records that are not subject to disclosure include records containing proprietary information, home addresses and phone numbers of school system employees, records related to school security, some information contained in personnel files and student education records.</p>
<h2>How do I make a Public Record Request?</h2>
<p>To make a public record request to the Jefferson Parish School Board or the Jefferson Parish Public School System, go to the link above, complete the form and submit your request to the Legal Department.  You may also mail your request to the Legal Department or submit a request via e-mail to: <a href=""/mailto:padams.legal@jpschools.org"">INTERNAL LINK padams.legal@jpschools.org</a>.</p>
<h2>What happens after I make my request?</h2>
<p>Legal Counsel will review and respond to all requests for public records.  You will receive an e-mail acknowledging receipt of your request.  It is important that you provide current contact information as it may be necessary to contact you in order to clarify the request or confirm that you are willing to pay for copies.  While responses will be provided as expeditiously as possible, response time will, of necessity, depend on the scope of the request and how the documents are stored.</p>

<h1>Legal</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>As Chief Legal Counsel for Jefferson Parish Schools, Patricia A. Adams, J.D., advises the Superintendent, Department Heads and school-based administrators on a wide variety of legal matters that arise in the K through 12 educational environment.</p>
<p>Representative legal matters include all aspects of the employment relationship, from recruitment and hiring to employee discipline and separation, employee grievances, employee benefits and employee rights under Title VII, Title IX, ADEA, ADA, FMLA and corresponding state law.</p>
<p>Typical school law matters include student rights and responsibilities under state and federal law and Board policy, constitutional issues of free speech, search and seizure and student discipline, special education under the IDEA and Section 504, and student confidentiality and privacy under FERPA and La. R.S. 17:3914.</p>
<p>Ms. Adams represents the district before state and federal administrative agencies, oversees the district’s response to requests for records, including requests for public records under the Louisiana Public Records Act (La. R.S. 44:1, et seq.), and is responsible for the drafting, review and revision of contracts and district policies.</p>
<h2>Public Record Request</h2>
<p><a href=""/Page/3224"">INTERNAL LINK Make a Public Record Request</a></p>
<p>Anyone eighteen (18) years of age or older may make a request for public records.  The requester is entitled to inspect or obtain a copy of a public record produced by, or in the possession of, a public entity.  The right to make such a request is granted by the State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Public Records Act, La. R.S. 44:1, et seq., and Article 3, Section 3 of the Louisiana Constitution.</p>
<p>Public records are documents that are prepared, possessed, used or retained for use by a public body in the conduct, performance or transaction of public business, regardless of the physical form or characteristics, and including information in electronic format.</p>
<p>Not all records are subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act.  Some records are expressly exempt from disclosure under the Act, while others may be withheld where there is a recognized constitutional right, such as the right to privacy under Art. I, Section 5 of the Louisiana Constitution.  Examples of the records that are not subject to disclosure include records containing proprietary information, home addresses and phone numbers of school system employees, records related to school security, some information contained in personnel files and student education records.</p>
<h2>How do I make a Public Record Request?</h2>
<p>To make a public record request to the Jefferson Parish School Board or the Jefferson Parish Public School System, go to the link above, complete the form and submit your request to the Legal Department.  You may also mail your request to the Legal Department or submit a request via e-mail to: <a href=""/mailto:padams.legal@jpschools.org"">INTERNAL LINK padams.legal@jpschools.org</a>.</p>
<h2>What happens after I make my request?</h2>
<p>Legal Counsel will review and respond to all requests for public records.  You will receive an e-mail acknowledging receipt of your request.  It is important that you provide current contact information as it may be necessary to contact you in order to clarify the request or confirm that you are willing to pay for copies.  While responses will be provided as expeditiously as possible, response time will, of necessity, depend on the scope of the request and how the documents are stored.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Jefferson Parish Schools Food Services Department is responsible for preparing and serving meals offered to students and staff throughout the district. Breakfast and lunch are offered in all schools. Students are offered a variety of healthy meals daily. Menus are planned following United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines with an emphasis on the use of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Modified menus for students with dietary restrictions are also available. Contact Jamie Hooks, LDN, RD at 504-349-7768  for more information.</p>
<p>Please note that last minute menu changes may occur at our schools due to nationwide food supply chain issues. Menus on the district website may not reflect these changes. If you have any questions regarding your school's menu, please reach out to your school's cafeteria manager. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.  </p>
<h2>Programs &amp; Services</h2>
<p>USDA has extended free meals for <strong>ALL</strong> students through the 2021-2022 school year.<strong>  </strong>However, families are still encouraged to complete a <a href=""https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01"">free and reduced meal application</a>. These applications support our meal program and help determine additional school funding. Questions regarding meal eligibilities or free and reduced meal applications should be made to Daytona Tucker, Applications Manager, at 504-349-7687.</p>
<p>The direct website link to the Free and Reduced Online Application is <a href=""https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01"">https://frapps.horizonsolana.com/JEFP01</a></p>

<h1>Teacher of the Year was a great success.</h1>
Posted by Patrick Giles on 2/10/2020 




<p><img alt=""Teacher of the Year Logo "" id="""" role=""presentation"" src=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/124/Ruby_Apple_Teacher of the Year_A3_export.png"" style="""" width=""250""/></p>
<p>We celebrated Jefferson Parish School's best teachers this month with a new design. Everyone knows that fantastic teachers are the jewels in the crown of our district, so that's what we wanted to convey in our design. The commonly used apple icon was updated to reflect the oppulence of our district, with its wealth of amazing teachers.</p>
<p>Our design carried over into every aspect of the event. We printed and grommeted a twenty foot banner, printed easel signs, and we even created individually cut apple placemats for each placesetting.</p>
<p><img alt=""Banner "" id="""" role=""presentation"" src=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/124/Teacher of the Year Banner.jpg"" style="""" width=""250""/>   <img alt=""Certificate "" id="""" role=""presentation"" src=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/124/Teacher of the Year Certificate apple.jpg"" style="""" width=""250""/><img alt=""Easel "" id="""" role=""presentation"" src=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/124/Teacher of the Year Certificate Easel Sign.jpg"" style="""" width=""250""/></p>

<h1>Displaying School Mottos, Vision Statements, Mission Statements can make a big impact.</h1>
Posted by Patrick Giles on 12/10/2019 11:30:00 AM 




<p>Here at the Print Shop, we've had many requests from schools to help with letting the students, parents, and teachers know the ultimate goal of the school, as well as encourage school spirit. </p>
<p>Green Park Elementary School decided that displaying photos of the students and teachers along with the school motto, school vision statements, and school mission statements were an excellent way to jumpstart engagement with everyone. We created 24"" x 36"" posters that were displayed throughout the school.</p>
<p>See below to see what we came up with and how this added touch can make a real difference in a school's culture.</p>
<p>If you would like to use this simple, effective technique, please email <a href=""/mailto:karen.richmond@jpschools.org"">INTERNAL LINK Karen Richmond</a>. Let us know what you would like to order and we can get your school on its way to achieving its goal.</p>

<h1>The importance of school spirit.</h1>
Posted by Patrick Giles on 7/22/2019 




<p>Do you remember when you were in high school and you bled your high school colors? You may have known a school phrase that gave you and your classroom friends the courage to succeed in the face of adversity. Sometimes it was used at the football field or on the basketball court. It could have been used as a greeting or as an act of encouragement before the BIG exam.</p>
<p>The administration at East Jefferson High School sure know the importance of a good, strong statement for any precarious situation. ""Be a Warrior!"", in everything you do.</p>
<p><img alt=""Be a warrior! "" id="""" role=""presentation"" src=""/cms/lib/LA50000440/Centricity/Domain/124/BeAWarrior_Banner_48X9_A.jpg"" style="""" width=""250""/></p>
<p>To boost student morale and camaraderie, the Print Shop created posters and banners for every hallway and building to bolster one simple maxim. The administrators want every student to be a person who is aggressively, courageously, or energetically involved in an activity that will positively impact their lives in the short and long term.</p>
<p>You can work with the Print Shop to help encourage your students to take up your battle cry as well. Contact <a href=""/mailto:karen.richmond@jpschools.org"">INTERNAL LINK Karen Richmond</a> to help add some school spirit.</p>

<p>The band program helps students to develop an understanding and appreciation of music. The program takes students with no previous playing experience to advanced status.</p>
<p>The band program is presently offered in 20 elementary schools. Students are introduced to an understanding and appreciation of music. They may learn to play a recorder and advance to an instrument. Students may participate in the district’s Superintendent’s Band Festival held in the spring.</p>
<p>The band program at the middle school level may continue to enhance an understanding and appreciation of music. For most students, this may be their first experience to the band program. Students will participate in the Superintendent’s Band Festival and may be eligible for participation in various Louisiana Music Educators’ Association (LMEA). Many students with the band program also march in Carnival parades and perform for community events.</p>
<p>The band program at the high school level allows students to study theory and analysis, music history, creative activities and aesthetic perception, and performances. Students may take course for credit in the study of music. They may also be involved in co-curricular activities. Many students have received scholarships to universities for post secondary music studies.</p>

<h3>INTEGRATED ART LESSONS</h3>
<h5>Integrated Arts Education</h5>
<p><a href=""http://www.artseducation.org/integratedartscurr.html"">http://www.artseducation.org/integratedartscurr.html</a><br/>Instruction that is integrated combines teaching in two or more subject areas. The purpose of integrated instruction is to help students gain a deep understanding of an important concept that is common to all the subjects involved. Student work is geared to specific goals and assessments in those subject areas. By combining knowledge and thinking in different disciplines, students learn to apply knowledge learned in one area to challenges in another area—a skill that will serve them well—both in school and in real life. Arts integration means that the arts (dance, music, theatre and visual art) constitute one or more of the integrated subject areas. Arts integration is not a substitute for teaching the arts as separate subjects. Rather it complements traditional arts instruction and helps to affirm the relevance of the arts in the school curriculum.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>With the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children’s Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142) and reauthorization of IDEA in 2004, the federal government mandates that early intervention be a key in educating young children ages 3 to 5 with developmental disabilities to achieve their highest potential. Jefferson Parish began providing services to special education preschool students in 1977 after federal dollars were granted to states to provide services. Over the past 30 years, legislation and research in best practices has prompted change in the way in which early childhood services ideally can be organized and delivered in Jefferson Parish Public Schools. Students are provided access to a range of high quality learning opportunities in the natural environment which is where young children would be playing, learning, and participating if they did not have a disability. Our goal is to provide inclusion opportunities for 3-5 year old students to be educated alongside age appropriate peers with supports whenever possible to meet federal guidelines as well as to mutually benefit both the young child with special needs and the typically developing peer.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>The Special Education Early Childhood Program provides early intervention services to nurture the social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development of young students. The program instructs the students in the skills they need to appropriately interact with family, school, and community, as independently as possible within the realm of their capabilities. The program is committed to fostering positive self-esteem and a healthy respect for individual differences. It is also our goal to promote a sense of belonging and active participation for every child whether they are educated in the home, community, or school setting.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Curriculum</h1>

<p>The Special Education Early Childhood Program attempts to improve each child’s abilities through developmentally appropriate practices with activity-based instruction and a functional, child-based curriculum based on the Louisiana Early Learning Standards. The Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale-R is used to balance child initiated activities with teacher directed activities and establish the daily schedule within the classroom setting. This promotes predictability, a sense of security, and helps students make smooth transitions to become progressively independent. Learning occurs throughout daily routines and activities and is based on the La. Comprehensive Curriculum for all students. Classroom activities may include story time, thematic unit activities, art, music, large motor development, fine motor development, and hygiene, snack, and rest time. Children learn through play in centers such as blocks, housekeeping, library, art, science, and table toys. The classrooms are equipped with a variety of art media, manipulatives, computers, and other assistive devices.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Eligibility</h1>

<p>The Special Education Early Childhood Program serves 3-5 year old students who are identified as having a disabling condition. The disabling condition is identified by an evaluation conducted or reviewed by Child Search, a multi-disciplinary evaluation team. A child is eligible if his/her disabling condition meets criteria for an exceptionality specified in the Louisiana Department of Education Pupil Appraisal Handbook.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Program Options</h1>

<p>Program decisions are made on an individual basis at the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting according to the needs of the child. In attempting to service student’s needs in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)as mandated by best practices and federal laws, Jefferson Parish Public School System offers the following special education early childhood options.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Community Home Program for 3 Year Olds</h1>

<p>Community/Home services are provided by an Early Childhood teacher to identified 3 year old students with special needs in their home, Head Start, or private setting chosen by the parents. These students are voluntarily enrolled in these settings and all expenses are incurred by the parents. These settings must be within Jefferson Parish. Jefferson Parish Public School System provides an itinerant early childhood teacher that works directly with students in the home or early childhood setting planning integrated activities to enhance modeling opportunities and cooperative play. The teacher also collaborates, supports, and consults care givers in the home and/or staff of the school that the child is attending and any related service providers working with the young child in making appropriate adaptations and modifications in the learning environment to address the special needs of a student. Students qualifying for related services may receive those services at an assigned Jefferson Parish Public School. JPPSS will also collaborate with Head Start to assist in providing technical support and opportunities for teacher training and professional development.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Community/Home Program for 4 and 5 Year Olds</h1>

<p>Community/Home services may also be provided to identified 4 or 5 year old students with special needs in their home, Head Start, or private settings which are chosen by the parents. These students are voluntarily enrolled in these settings and all expenses are incurred by the parents. These settings must be within Jefferson Parish. The itinerant teacher works directly with students in the home or preschool setting planning integrated activities to enhance modeling opportunities and cooperative play. The teacher also collaborates, supports, and consults with the care givers and/or staff in the preschool or home settings in making adaptations and modifications in the learning environment to address the special needs of a student. Students qualifying for related services may receive those services at an assigned Jefferson Parish School.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>4 and 5 year old Classroom Placement</h1>

<p>The Special Education Early Childhood Program provides services to identified students with mild to severe disabilities. These self-contained classes are located on an elementary school site. The students are served by a Paraprofessional Training Unit which provides a low pupil/teacher ratio. The number of paraprofessionals assigned to the unit varies with the number of students in the class. Full or partial inclusion with typical peers is a common practice for prekindergarten and kindergarten aged children.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Categorical Program</h1>

<p>The Categorical Preschool classes provide services to 4 and 5 year old students on certain elementary school sites for students identified with low-incidence exceptionalities. These exceptionalities include Autism, Hearing Impairments, Orthopedic Impairments, and Visual Impairments. These classes may provide lower pupil/teacher ratios and specific instructional methods for these students. Students will also be included with typical peers through blended practices or by attending a prekindergarten or kindergarten class when possible.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Special education provides vision, leadership, and expertise to schools and offices regarding the implementation of curricular and instructional initiatives that support the achievement of students with disabilities in compliance with state and federal mandates.</p>
<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>The department of compliance has a responsibility, under federal statute and regulations, to have a system of general supervision that monitors the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) by local education agencies, or school districts. The system is accountable for enforcing the requirements and for ensuring continuous improvement. The primary focus of federal and state monitoring activities are to improve educational results and functional outcomes for all children with disabilities and ensure that states meet the program requirements under this part, with a particular emphasis on those requirements that are closely related to improving educational results for children with disabilities.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Physical education is an essential part of the basic educational program and contributes to the development of the total individual. Every student with a disability is entitled to participate in a program activity, specially designed if necessary. Adapted physical educators facilitate the optimal physical and emotional development of children with disabilities and recognize the wide range of motor abilities found in atypical populations. Adapted Physical Education (APE) services accommodate students of all ages and functional abilities via systemically designed instructional programs focused on functional mobility skills, motor and physical fitness, life time leisure and age-appropriate gross motor competencies.</p>

<h1>What is Adapted Physical Education?</h1>

<p>Adapted Physical Education is an INSTRUCTIONAL program provided by teachers certified in Adapted Physical Education.<br/>It is a specifically designed physical education program for students with disabilities who are unable to participate and benefit fully in regular physical education.<br/>It is individualized to meet the identified motor/physical education needs of students in special education.<br/>The student’s program may include consultation, support, modifications or inclusion in regular PE, OR self-contained Adapted PE instruction, OR a combination of regular and adapted physical education.</p>
<p>The APE Program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction by teachers certified in Adapted PE</li>
<li>Curriculum aligned with Louisiana Physical Education standards</li>
<li>Peer-tutoring</li>
<li>Buddy Program in regular P.E.</li>
<li>Orientation and Mobility Skills</li>
<li>Health Education</li>
<li>Creole Curriculum/Wheelchair Sports and Mobility Curriculum</li>
<li>Special Olympics</li>
<li>Sports for individuals with physical disabilities</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Why is Adapted PE Important?</h1>

<p>Movement is a pre-requisite for most of our educational activities. Individuals with inefficient movement patterns may encounter added difficulties in vocational, social, emotional and educational areas. It is essential to provide success-oriented activities to students who have interests, capabilities and limitations that are not met through the regular PE program.<br/>Adapted PE emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical and motor fitness</li>
<li>Motor skills and patterns</li>
<li>Body mechanics</li>
<li>Individual games and sports for lifetime enjoyment and fitness</li>
<li>Leisure/recreation activities</li>
<li>Healthy Lifestyles</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are also taught to apply motor and recreational skills to various home and community settings, to facilitate socialization, self and peer group acceptance, and normalization in the community.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>How Students Receive Adapted PE</h1>

<p>Students must qualify for Adapted physical education according to criteria established by the Louisiana Department of Education. When a student is having difficulty performing in regular physical education, a motor screening is initially conducted by the regular physical education teacher PRIOR to referral. The Academic/ Behavioral Intervention Team at the school will be contacted. If warranted, evaluation will then be conducted by Adapted PE personnel. When a student qualifies for APE services, the type and frequency of services will be determined by the IEP team.</p>
<p>Students who have the following characteristics will be considered for screening and referral:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developmental delays in chronologically age-appropriate motor skills;</li>
<li>Difficulty with equilibrium responses and balance activities;</li>
<li>Lack of strength, endurance, flexibility;</li>
<li>Poor body or spatial awareness;</li>
<li>Chronic medical conditions;</li>
<li>Lack of appropriate play and socialization behavior;</li>
<li>Poor auditory processing.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Where and When Students Receive Adapted PE</h1>

<p>Students receive APE during their school day. The class is scheduled according to the needs of the student as indicated on the IEP. Typically, students participate in some regular physical education with support from a para-educator or inclusion support from the adapted physical education teacher. However, many students require instruction in a self-contained class with other students with disabilities. Instruction may occur outdoors on school grounds, in the gym, or in another defined space.</p>

<li>


<p>The Arts in Education program enhances the classroom curriculum of students with special needs and engages them in the learning process through arts integration. The program provides artist residencies, staff development for teachers, performances by professional artists, talent development, and Very Special Arts Festivals.</p>
<h2>Arts Residencies</h2>
<p>Funding from current Federal Public Law along with grants from the Louisiana Division of the Arts, Louisiana Decentralized Arts Funding Program, VSA arts of Louisiana, and other public sources enable professional arts educators to work in classrooms through artist residency programs. These artists implement Disciplined-Based Art Education programs that reinforce GLEs (grade level expectations) across the curriculum and facilitate creative expression. Elementary as well as secondary schools within the parish receive artist-in-the classroom residencies on a rotating basis.</p>
<h2>Teacher Workshops</h2>
<p>The artist/facilitator and contracted arts educators conduct parish-wide workshops for teachers that enhance arts integration and support Act 175. This legislation, passed in 2007, requires Louisiana K-8 public schools to provide 60 minutes of instruction in the performing arts and 60 minutes of instruction in the visual arts each week for all students beginning in the 2010-2011 school year.</p>
<h2>Performing Artists</h2>
<p>Festival grants from VSA arts of Louisiana and the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Foundation support yearly performances by various groups including: Playmakers of Baton Rouge Children’s Theater, Jazz Centennial Celebration (Charmaine Neville and Band), and Papillion. These performances take place during the weeks designated for Very Special Arts Festivals.</p>
<h2>Very Special Arts Fesitvals</h2>
<p>Very Special Arts Festivals are held in participating schools during designated weeks of each school year. These school-based celebrations bring guest artists to schools to work with students with special needs in self-contained classes, inclusion settings and large assemblies. Teaching artists (TA) conduct art activities in classrooms while performing artists (PA) present live performances for student assemblies. In-keeping with the school system’s policy of inclusion, students from the general education program participate in VSA Festival events along with students with special needs. The principal of each school designates a teacher as the festival director who guides his/her school in designing activities that meet specific needs and wishes. Funding, planning resources and on-going support comes from Special Programs and VSA arts of Louisiana. Approximately 70 schools participate each year, with the over-all program impacting approximately 9,000 students.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Assistive technology devices are mechanical aids which substitute for or enhance the function of some physical or mental ability that is impaired. Assistive technology can be anything homemade, purchased off the shelf, modified, or commercially available which is used to help an individual perform some task of daily living. The term assistive technology encompasses a broad range of devices from “low tech” (e.g., pencil grips, splints, paper stabilizers) to “high tech” (e.g., computers, voice synthesizers, braille readers). These devices include the entire range of supportive tools and equipment from adapted spoons to wheelchairs and computer systems for environmental control.</p>
<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal special education law, provides the following legal definition of an assistive technology device: “any item, piece of equipment, or product system… that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.” Under IDEA, assistive technology devices can be used in the educational setting to provide a variety of accommodations or adaptations for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The IDEA also lists the services a school district may need to provide in order to ensure that assistive technology is useful to a student in the school setting. The law defines assistive technology service as: “any service that directly assists an individual with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device.” This service includes all of the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>evaluation of the technology needs of the individual, including a functional evaluation in the individual’s customary environment;</li>
<li>purchasing, leasing, or otherwise providing for the acquisition of assistive technology devices for individuals with disabilities;</li>
<li>selecting, designing, fitting, customizing, adapting, applying, maintaining, repairing, or replacing of assistive technology devices;</li>
<li>coordinating and using other therapies, interventions, or services with assistive technology devices, such as those associated with existing education and rehabilitation plans and programs;</li>
<li>assistive technology training or technical assistance with assistive technology for an individual with a disability, or, where appropriate, the family of an individual with disabilities;</li>
<li>training or technical assistance for professionals, employers, or other individuals who provide services to, employ, or otherwise are substantially involved in the major life functions of individuals with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The intention of the special education law is that, if a student with disabilities needs technology in order to be able to learn, the school district will (a) evaluate the student’s technology needs, (b) acquire the necessary technology, (c) coordinate technology use with other therapies and interventions, and (d) provide training for the individual, the individual’s family, and the school staff in the effective use of the technology.</p>
<p>During the time that students with disabilities are in school, they can have the opportunity to learn to use technology at the same time that they are learning academic subjects and social skills. The efficient and effective use of assistive technology can be as basic a skill for students with disabilities as reading, writing, and arithmetic since the use of technology can go a long way toward circumventing the limitations of the disability and providing students with disabilities with a “level playing field” in every area of life accomplishment.</p>

<h1>What are Accommodations?</h1>

<p>Accommodations are reasonable modifications that are made to compensate for skills or abilities that an individual lacks. For example, if a person does not digest spicy foods well, we might accommodate this individual by adjusting his or her diet so that the person was eating only bland foods.<br/>When the word accommodation is used in connection with disability issues, it refers to a way of modifying a task or assignment so that a person with a disability can participate in spite of whatever challenges the disability may pose. For example, when a student who is unable to remember math facts is allowed to do math problems with a calculator, the use of the calculator is an accommodation which allows the student to work around his or her disability. With an accommodation, the student can still perform math problems, but the student does so using a different method.<br/>In the school setting, sometimes it is necessary to make accommodations for individuals with disabilities in order to compensate for skills or abilities that they do not have. For example, for some students with learning disabilities, learning to spell words correctly may be a skill they never acquire or never acquire with a high enough degree of fluency to do them any good in written expression. To compensate for this inability to spell, such students may be encouraged to use alternative methods for spelling like a spell check software program on the computer or a hand-held spelling device.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>What is an Adaptation? How Does Adaptation Differ From Accommodation?</h1>

<p>Adaptation means developing unique devices or methods designed specifically to assist persons with disabilities to perform daily tasks. An adaptation is something specially designed which is not normally used by other people. An accommodation, on the other hand, is simply a change in routine, method, or approach which may be used by people with or without disabilities. Examples of adaptations include special grips to turn stove knobs or specially designed keyboards to operate computers.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>What are Common Types of Assistive Technology? Does Assistive Technology Just Mean Computers?</h1>

<p>Assistive technology certainly includes computers, but it also refers to a number of other types of accommodations and adaptations which enable individuals with disabilities to function more independently. Computers are an important type of assistive technology because they open up so many exciting possibilities for writing, speaking, finding information, or controlling an individual’s environment. But computers are not the only avenues to solving problems through technology. There are many low tech (and low cost) solutions for problems that disabilities pose. Examples of inexpensive, low tech solutions include wrist splints, clip boards for holding papers steady, or velcro tabs to keep positioning pads in place.</p>
<p><strong>The following is a list of common assistive technology applications:</strong><br/><strong>Positioning.</strong> In the classroom, individuals with physical disabilities may need assistance with their positions for seating so that they can participate effectively in school work. Generally, therapists try to achieve an upright, forward facing position by using padding, structured chairs, straps, supports, or restraints to hold the body in a stable and comfortable manner. Also considered is the student’s position in relation to peers and the teacher. Often, it is necessary to design positioning systems for a variety of settings so that the student can participate in multiple activities at school. Examples of equipment used for positioning are side lying frames, walkers, crawling assists, floor sitters, chair inserts, wheelchairs, straps, trays, standing aids, bean bag chairs, sand bags, and so forth.<br/><strong>Access.</strong> In order to participate in school tasks, some students require special devices that provide access to computers or environmental controls. The first step in providing access is to determine which body parts can be used to indicate the student’s intentions. Controllable, anatomical sites like eye blinks, head or neck movements, or mouth movements may be used to operate equipment which provides access to the computer. Once a controllable, anatomical site has been determined, then decisions can be made about input devices, selection techniques (direct, scanning), and acceleration strategies (coding, prediction). Input devices include such things as switches, alternative keyboards, mouse, trackball, touch window, speech recognition, and head pointers. Once computer access has been established, it should be coordinated with other systems that the student is using including powered mobility, communication or listening devices, and environmental control systems.</p>

</ul>
<p>Access can also refer to physical entrance and exit of buildings or facilities. This kind of assistive technology includes modifications to buildings, rooms and other facilities that let people with physical impairments use ramps and door openers to enter, allow people with visual disabilities to follow braille directions and move more freely within a facility, and people of short stature or people who use wheelchairs to reach pay phones or operate elevators. Accessibility to shopping centers, places of business, schools, recreation, transportation is possible because of assistive technology modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Control.</strong> Independent use of equipment in the classroom can be achieved for students with physical disabilities through various types of environmental controls, including remote control switches and special adaptations of on/off switches to make them accessible (e.g. velcro attachments, pointer sticks).</p>
<p>Robotic arms and other environmental control systems turn lights on and off, open doors, operate appliances. Locational and orientation systems give people with vision impairments information about where they are, what the ground nearby is like, and whether or not there is a curb close by.</p>
<p><strong>Augmentative Communication.</strong> Every student in school needs some method of communication in order to interact with others and learn from social contact. Students who are nonverbal or whose speech is not fluent or understandable enough to communicate effectively may benefit from using some type of communication device or devices. Communication devices include such things as symbol systems, communication boards and wallets, programmable switches, electronic communication devices, speech synthesizers, recorded speech devices, communication enhancement software, and voiced word processing.</p>
<p><strong>Assistive Listening.</strong> Much of the time in school, students are expected to learn through listening. Students who have hearing impairments or auditory processing problems can be at a distinct disadvantage unless they learn to use the hearing they have, or they develop alternative means for getting information. Hearing problems may be progressive, permanent, or intermittent. Any of these impairments may interfere significantly with learning to speak, read, and follow directions. Assistive devices to help with hearing and auditory processing problems include: hearing aids, personal FM units, sound field FM systems, Phonic Ear, TDDs, or closed caption TV.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Aids.</strong> Vision is also a major learning mode. General methods for assisting with vision problems include increasing contrast, enlarging stimuli and making use of tactile and auditory models. Devices that assist with vision include screen readers, screen enlargers, magnifiers, large-type books, taped books, Braillers, light boxes, high contrast materials, thermoform graphics, synthesizers, and scanners.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility.</strong> Individuals whose physical impairments limit their mobility may need any of a number of devices to help them get around in the school building and participate in student activities. Mobility devices include such things as self-propelled walkers, manual or powered wheelchairs, and powered recreational vehicles like bikes and scooters.</p>
<p><strong>Computer-Based Instruction.</strong> Computer-based instruction can make possible independent participation in activities related to the curriculum. Software can be selected which mirrors the conceptual framework of the regular curriculum, but offers an alternative way of responding to exercises and learning activities. Software can provide the tools for written expression, spelling, calculation, reading, basic reasoning, and higher level thinking skills. The computer can also be used to access a wide variety of databases.</p>
<p><strong>Social Interaction and Recreation.</strong> Students with disabilities want to have fun and interact socially with their peers. Assistive technology can help them to participate in all sorts of recreational activities which can be interactive with friends. Some adapted recreational activities include drawing software, computer games, computer simulations, painting with a head or mouth wand, interactive laser disks, and adapted puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>Self Care.</strong> In order to benefit from education, some students require assistance with self care activities like feeding, dressing, and toileting. Assistive devices which assist with self care include such things as robotics, electric feeders, adapted utensils, specially designed toilet seats, and aids for tooth brushing, washing, dressing, and grooming.</p>


</li>

<h1>What Sort of Students Might Use Assistive Technology?</h1>

<p>Students who require assistive technology are those with mental or physical impairments that interfere with learning or other life functions. The technology helps the student to overcome or compensate for the impairment and be more independent in participating at school. Students who benefit from assistive technology may have mild learning problems like learning disabilities or they may have physical or cognitive disabilities that range from mild to severe. Assistive technology is not necessary or helpful for every student in special education, but it is an important part of the support system for many students with identified disabilities.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Isn't Assistive Technology Appropriate Only For Students with More Severe Disabilities?</h1>

<p>Assistive technology is simply a set of tools that can be used to compensate for some deficit that a person may have. For individuals with severe mental or physical disabilities, the technological solutions can help to solve multiple and complex problems, but individuals with less involved problems also can benefit from assistive technology. For example, individuals with learning disabilities who have difficulty with reading or writing can benefit educationally from using the word processing and voiced reading capabilities of computers.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Isn't Assistive Technology Just a Crutch? Won't Students Become Too Dependent on Technology and Not Learn to Use the Skills They Have?</h1>

<p>Assistive technology should be used as support for learning and performing daily tasks. In general, assistive technology is appropriate when it compensates for disabilities so that the individual can function as normally as possible. If assistive technology is necessary for a student to have access to educational opportunities, or to benefit from education, then it is not a “crutch,” but a legitimate support.</p>
<p>Some skills are too laborious or taxing to accomplish at a rate or with degree of proficiency to allow for participation in the least restrictive environment. With assistive technology, the student can participate more fully and more closely approximate the levels of achievement and interaction of his or her peers.</p>
<p>The use of assistive technology enhances function and increases skills and opportunities. Though a student may be dependent upon a particular device in order to perform skillfully, denying the device denies the student an opportunity ever to achieve success at the level of his or her potential.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>When is Using Assistive Technology Appropriate?</h1>

<p>Assistive technology may be considered appropriate when it does any or all of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables an individual to perform functions that can be achieved by no other means</li>
<li>Enables an individual to approximate normal fluency, rate, or standards–a level of accomplishment which could not be achieved by any other means</li>
<li>Provides access for participation in programs or activities which otherwise would be closed to the individual</li>
<li>Increases endurance or ability to persevere and complete tasks that otherwise are too laborious to be attempted on a routine basis</li>
<li>Enables an individual to concentrate on learning or employment tasks, rather than mechanical tasks</li>
<li>Provides greater access to information</li>
<li>Supports normal social interactions with peers and adults</li>
<li>Supports participation in the least restrictive educational environment.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Assistive technology means any device which helps an individual with an impairment to perform tasks of daily living. There is a wide range of types of devices in assistive technology from low tech, homemade aids to computers and sophisticated electronic equipment. Assistive technology is one of the services which can be provided in a special education program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The requirements of IDEA say that students who need assistive technology are entitled to the aids and devices and the assistive technology services (e.g., evaluation for assistive technology and modification and maintenance of equipment) that are necessary for the student to benefit from a free, appropriate public education (FAPE).</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>For some students, the provision of a free appropriate public education(FAPE) means extending instruction and related services beyond the typical school year. An extended school year program must be provided for any student with disabilities who is eligible for such services,and the determination of eligibility to provide such services is made annually by the IEP team. Preparation for the determination must begin early in the school year in order to carefully collect the data that will be needed in order to make an accurate determination. Teachers collect data relating to specific skills and behaviors that have been identified on the current Individualized Education Plan (IEP), just as they would to determine if appropriate progress is being made during the school year. The decision of whether or not a child is eligible is determined by a student’s ability to maintain learned skills identified on the IEP during the typical school year.</p>
<p>Extended School Year (ESY) services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to maintain learned skills, not develop new skills</li>
<li>to target goals and objectives derived from the current IEP</li>
<li>determined on an individualized, case by case basis</li>
<li>provided at no cost to families, and with no budgetary constraints as a factor</li>
<li>based on the needs of the individual child, and thus there is no specific amount of time required (typically not the same as what the child may receive during the school year)</li>
<li>developed through creative use of educational and other personnel</li>
<li>provided in a variety of environments, including the home setting</li>
<li>available to any student who is eligible</li>
<li>evaluated annually and based on data collected during the current year to determine eligibility</li>
<li>discussed at the IEP meeting by the IEP team</li>
</ul>
<p>Extended School Year (ESY) services are not:</p>
<ul>
<li>to develop new skills</li>
<li>a traditional summer school program</li>
<li>to meet newly developed goals and objectives</li>
<li>to make up for absences incurred during vacation or suspension</li>
<li>provided for the convenience of families, e.g. to substitute for childcare or to maintain the families’ job security</li>
<li>to replace or duplicate alternative community resources</li>
</ul>
<p>The IEP team must discuss ESY services at an initial IEP meeting and at every annual IEP meeting. Team members may also discuss ESY services through an addendum to the annual IEP if necessary. School staff members, parent(s), and/or the student may request an IEP meeting at any time to discuss ESY services.</p>
<p>ESY services are only necessary to ensure a FAPE when the benefits a student gains during the regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if the student is not provided with an educational program during breaks in instruction. ESY services are intended to address critical life skills. A critical life skill includes any skill determined by the IEP team to be critical to the student’s overall educational progress, including social and behavior skills. In determining critical life skills for the specific needs of the student, the IEP team may consider those skills that lead to independent living, including toileting, feeding, communicating, dressing, and other self-help skills. In some cases, the IEP team may consider and address academic and behavioral issues. Depending on factors, such as a student’s age, ability, and the number of years the student has left in school, the areas of reading, math, and written language could be considered critical life skills.</p>
<p>Any child receiving special education services, regardless of disability category, may be eligible to receive ESY services if the IEP team determines that they are necessary for the student to receive FAPE. The IEP team members should discuss the following factors when they are considering ESY services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regression and Recoupment</strong>–The IEP team must determine whether, without these services, there is a likelihood of substantial regression of critical life skills caused by a school break and it is expected that the student will not recover those lost skills within a reasonable amount of time following the school break (e.g., six to eight weeks after summer break).</li>
<li><strong>Degree of Progress</strong>–The IEP team must review the student’s progress toward the IEP goals and objectives targeting critical life skills and determines whether, without these services, the student’s degree or rate of progress toward those goals or objectives significantly jeopardize the student’s receipt of educational benefit from his or her educational program during the regular school year.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging Skills and Breakthrough Opportunities</strong>–The IEP team reviews all IEP goals targeting critical life skills to determine whether any of these skills are at a breakthrough point. When critical life skills are at this point, the IEP team needs to determine whether the interruption in services and instruction on those goals or objectives during the school break is likely to significantly jeopardize the student’s receipt of educational benefit from his or her educational program during the regular school year.</li>
<li><strong>Interfering Behaviors</strong>–The IEP team determines whether the student demonstrates any interfering behavior(s) such as stereotypic, ritualistic, aggressive, or self-injurious behavior(s) targeted by the IEP goals which substantially jeopardize the student’s receipt of educational benefit from his or her educational program during the regular school year. The team also determines whether the interruption of programming for these interfering behaviors is likely to significantly jeopardize the student’s receipt of benefit from his or her educational programming during the next school year.</li>
<li><strong>Nature and/or Severity of the Disability</strong>–The IEP team determines whether, without ESY services, the nature and/or severity of the student’s disability is likely to significantly jeopardize the student’s receipt of benefit from his or her educational program during the regular school year.</li>
<li><strong>Special Circumstances or Other Factors</strong>–The IEP team determines whether, without ESY services, there are any special circumstances that will significantly jeopardize the student’s receipt of benefit from his or her education program during the regular school year.</li>
</ul>
<p>ESY services may be delivered through a variety of settings and methods, examples of which might include classroom instruction, a parent-guided home program with progress periodically monitored by the teacher, and/or consultative or supervisory support from staff members within community settings.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Inclusion is an effort to make sure that all students benefit by becoming important and contributing members of their school communities.  It is the attempt to make sure that students with disabilities go to school along with their friends and neighbors while also receiving the “specially designed instruction and support” they need to succeed as learners and to achieve with high standards.  Inclusion is different than past efforts at mainstreaming and integration.  Inclusive schooling practices embrace the idea that, since everyone is an individual, schools, teaching, and learning must be organized so that every student gets a learning experience that “fits.”</p>
<h2>What Does an Inclusive School Look Like?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Administrators guide and support inclusive practices, ensuring a safe and welcoming environment</li>
<li>Teachers believe they are accountable for ALL students</li>
<li>The collaborative structures in place enables staff to be responsive to changes</li>
<li>Students with disabilities are educated along side their typical peers</li>
<li>All students are recognized and celebrated for their unique talents</li>
<li>All students are actively engaged</li>
<li>Classes consist of diverse learners</li>
<li>Teachers value each unique learning styles, and meet those individuals’ needs</li>
<li>Multiple methods of student expression and assessments exist</li>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a written plan developed for each student eligible under IDEA that describes how the school district will educate the student.  The parent(s) and a team of educators develop the IEP based on the available information about the student.  IDEA requires that school districts include comprehensive information about the student on the IEP, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic goals</li>
<li>Services the student will receive</li>
<li>Prescribed management of the student’s behaviors (if needed)</li>
<li>Accommodations to be provided in the general education and special education classrooms</li>
<li>Accommodations to be provided on statewide assessments</li>
<li>Type of statewide assessment in which the student will participate</li>
<li>Prescribed assistive technology (if needed)</li>
<li>Transition services and post-secondary outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>The IEP is the tool used to determine what services a student receives and what a free, appropriate, public education (FAPE) means for that student.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>Occupational and physical therapists provide services that includes improving, developing or restoring functions impaired or lost through illness, injury, or deprivation, improving ability to perform tasks for independent functioning, if functions are impaired or lost, and preventing, through early intervention, further impairment or loss of function.</p>
<p>Occupational therapists focus on fine motor skills, self help, and adaptive skills. Physical therapists focus on gross motor skills and mobility. Occupational therapy may be needed, for example, to acquire appropriate eating utensils for a child, or teach classroom personnel how to use the equipment, or to teach classroom staff how to adjust a lap board for a student who uses the lap board for writing activities. Physical therapy may be needed, for example, to teach transfers from a wheelchair to a chair or restroom facilities.</p>
<p>Occupational therapy and physical therapy are related services that may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from their education. These services are to provide a child with equal opportunity that would not exist without therapy service and not merely maximization of a child’s potential. Occupational therapists and physical therapists are trained to provide many types of developmental and rehabilitative services.</p>
<p>Legal mandates require the school-based therapist to deliver only those services that are necessary to assist students to benefit from their educational programs. The focus of school based therapy depends on which IEP goals therapy will be supporting. The need for therapy is based the choice of educational goals and whether the expertise of OT or PT is needed to help the student achieve those goals. Some goals may be academic while other goals will focus on student function or the student’s participation and success in the school environment.</p>

",,1,"<a></a>






<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The major goal of pupil appraisal personnel is to advocate for children. In partial pursuit of this goal, pupil appraisal personnel assist students and school staff in enhancing the benefits of a general education program whenever possible. If a student is suspected of having a disabling condition or an exceptional talent, pupil appraisal personnel attempt to provide a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary evaluation that reflects an student’s unique and current strengths and needs. The multi-disciplinary aspect of pupil appraisal is an ongoing effort to provide support and professional resources to students, their families, and school personnel.</p>
<p>Pupil Appraisal Services consist of three disciplines: educational diagnostician, school psychologist, and school social worker.</p>
<p>Pupil Appraisal Personnel provides support services to school’s Academic/Behavior Intervention Team (A/BIT), evaluation services, and teacher/staff development to schools to enhance outcomes for students.</p>
<p>Academic/Behavior Intervention Team (A/BIT) is a general education problem solving committee, chaired by the principal or administrative designee, and staffed with general and special educators, pupil appraisal, and related service personnel. Parents of referred students are also active members. It is not a fast track to special education identification, rather, it should be the engine that drives each school’s activities.</p>
<p>The purpose is to intercede with students determined to be at risk and provide interventions to remediate academic deficits or behavioral challenges. A three-tiered process, referred to as Response to Intervention (RTI), provides evidenced-based interventions and monitors progress in an effort to maintain the student in the general education setting, and at the same time, improve academic/behavior performance. Pupil Appraisal and related service personnel assist the A/BIT with intervention design, progress monitoring, data review, and decision making regarding the appropriate next steps for a student. Parents are notified each nine weeks of the student’s progress and status in the A/BIT process.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>

<p>Our mission is for all students to become independent, productive, contributing members of their communities, to their fullest ability. Our program is designed to support students in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>The staff at VSSD is committed to working with teachers, staff, students, and families in making this mission a reality.</p>

<h1>Community Skills</h1>

<p>The Community Skills program is a curriculum that addresses functional programming and focuses on providing instruction in life skills. The goal of the Community Skills Program is to provide opportunities for students to develop the skills that will enable them to live in the community as independently as possible.</p>
<p>Students with moderate to severe disabilities, autism, multiple disabilities, and students who are on alternate assessment may participate in the Community Skills Program.</p>
<p>Once it is determined that a student has qualified for the Community Skills Program, and that he/she would benefit from a functional program curriculum, a parental consent form is obtained. The teacher is then trained by the Community Skills Trainer. Once the teacher is trained, he/she will first provide the student with instruction in the classroom, and then extend the instruction into the community.</p>
<p>Students of elementary school age learn activities and skills within five basic instructional domains: a) personal management, b) academics, c) school responsibilities, d) neighborhood, and e) recreation. At this level, students receive instruction that will lead them to become self-sufficient in environments such as grocery stores, bakeries, drug and convenience stores, to name a few.</p>
<p>As students approach middle and high school ages, domains change to emphasize vocational training with an emphasis on related skills training in the areas of personal management, community and recreation/leisure. At this level, students receive instruction that will help them acquire skills for independence in environments such as malls, parks, post offices, restaurants, barber/beauty shops, and taxis. Instruction for recreation/leisure activities takes places in public libraries, theaters, bowling alleys, and parks. Teaching materials such as games, video and audio equipment, books, magazines, and newspapers, are a few of the resources utilized in the recreation/leisure domain.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Employment Exploration</h1>

<p>The Employment Exploration program provides Special Education Students the opportunity to experience working in a variety of local community businesses, while receiving the individualized levels of support needed for growth and success.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Accomplishing this Mission</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes local business participation and support</li>
<li>Takes parental support and understanding</li>
<li>Takes school system funding and support</li>
<li>Takes job trainer outreach and organization</li>
<li>Takes teacher dedication and creativity</li>
<li>Takes student interest and participation</li>
</ul>
<p>Meeting all of the above criteria is essential to having a program that fulfills students’ needs for present and future success.<br/></p>
<p><strong>How the Program Works</strong><br/>Over the course of a student’s high school career, he/she receives training in a variety of short-term non-paid job sites located throughout the community. Special education teachers, in the role of job trainer specialist, develop the individual training sites. The job trainers network with businesses to establish their support and understanding of the programs needs and goals. Each job site reflects a series of different skill clusters to offer a diverse set of work experiences as a student rotates through the sites, (usually two or more each year). Throughout the school year the teacher supervises the job experiences on a weekly basis. The teacher uses the job setting to develop and reinforce work skills, attitudes and behaviors, as well as provide useful evaluation information for future vocational planning.</p>
<p>As the student enters into the transitional phase of high school to adulthood, the instructional team considers post-school vocational options. Decisions based on the student/family choices and preferences for post-school vocational and living environments, opportunities within the local community and the student’s training history are supported and documented by the participation profile the program provides of the student’s competencies as they relate to specific employment areas and support needs after graduation.</p>
<p>Students exit school with an Employment Exploration job resume listing their individual job experiences, their strengths and interest, along with a linkage to adult agencies that can offer needed supports. More importantly students leave with a level of experiences that afford them self-confidence in their abilities and strengths and an understanding of working in the real world setting.</p>


</li>

<h1>Work Study Program</h1>

<p>One of the goals of our society is to allow and encourage citizens to be involved in gainful employment. To that end, the Special Programs Department, through the Work Study Program, offers job placement assistance to qualified students in the Alternative Program. Job placement assistance encompasses a full cascade of services from direct placement on job, to referral to an adult service agency for post-secondary vocational training prior to actual job placement.</p>
<p>The Work Study Program is designed to provide services in the form of assessment, training, placement and referrals. These services are offered to students with mild disabilities for the purpose of obtaining employment in the competitive job market upon exiting the school system.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Transition Services</h1>

<p>The transition from school to post-school options is difficult for all students. Students with disabilities face even greater challenges. The goal of education is to prepare student to live, work, and recreate in integrated community setting. To reach this goal, students, their families, schools, and community agencies work together to identify instructional programs, areas of responsibilities, and linkages necessary to meet the transition needs of exiting students with disabilities.<br/>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), P.L.105-17, defines transition as a coordinated set of activities for a student with a disability that:</p>
<p>(a) Is designed within an outcome-oriented process, which promotes movement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary, vocational training, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services independent living, or community participation;</p>
<p>(b) Is based upon the individual student’s needs taking into account the student’s preferences and interests;</p>
<p>(c) Includes instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives, and, when appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocational evaluation.</p>
<p>Put more simply, transition for students with disabilities means moving from one state in life to another (e.g., high school activities to adult life activities). Transition involves establishing a planning process that includes a coordinated set of supportive activities that will prepare students with disabilities to more successfully live their adult life.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Post Secondary Classes</h1>

<p>The Special Programs Department of the Jefferson Parish Public School System developed two post-secondary programs as an alternative to the more traditional high school programming. The goal of this program is to enhance the inclusion of young adults’ ages 19 -21 in age appropriate, integrated social and educational activities while promoting the process of transition from school to adult life.<br/>Specific topics related to the alternative post-secondary sites follow.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Curriculum</h1>

<p>Instruction focuses on an activity based approach to curriculum development and is based on student and family preference and the attainment of individual student outcomes upon exiting Jefferson Parish Public Schools. Students engage in off campus community based training activities including Employment Exploration and when appropriate, have access to selected course offerings available at the Technical Colleges. Enrollment in vocational courses is negotiated on an individual basis and is intended to promote inclusion in the instructional setting. Students will not receive certification in any vocational area as a result of their participation. Teachers are responsible for the implementation of all federally mandated regulations regarding Individual Education Plans (IEPs), referrals reevaluations, etc.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Student Identification and Selection</h1>

<p>The office of Vocational Services for Students with Disabilities (VSSD) notifies families and prospective students with significant disabilities of the opportunity to become acquainted with the post-secondary placement option through an annual open enrollment letter. Interested families are invited to attend an informational meeting hosted by the Vocational Services for Students with Disabilities department. Specific issues related to enrollment (including limits on class size and selection criteria) are addressed at that time. To make best use of transition time students are selected based on minimum age of 19 and appropriateness of placement.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Scheduling</h1>

<p>Student schedules are designed to correspond with student needs and preferences and include both on campus and off campus activities.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Calendar</h1>

<p>Teachers and students follow the current Jefferson Parish Schools calendar.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>It is the mission of the speech &amp; hearing program to secure the highest quality personnel, resources, and materials in order to provide the highest quality of services to students with communication impairments. The speech &amp; hearing program provides a continuum of services for communication-impaired students, including early identification, evaluation, therapy, and consultation. Speech therapy services are provided when it is documented that the student needs services to benefit from the educational program. These services are collaborative and focus on skills that promote attainment of educational objectives. Service delivery models may vary according to the needs of the student, and may include direct, consultative, and tracking/monitoring. Frequency of services is based on the student’s needs. Speech, hearing, and language services are provided for students identified according to the guidelines of the Louisiana Bulletin 1508. Services are provided for students ages 3-21 enrolled in Jefferson Parish Schools. Preschoolers (3-5 years) who attend school in Jefferson Parish and meet 1508 criteria may receive speech therapy in a JP Schools school setting. We also provide therapy for non-public speech-impaired students in a non-public setting according to the school accreditation.</p>
<p>Communication disorders may be exhibited by an impairment in any one or combination of the following:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href=""/Page/326"">INTERNAL LINK Fluency</a></li>
<li><a href=""/Page/327"">INTERNAL LINK Language</a></li>
<li><a href=""/Page/328"">INTERNAL LINK Voice</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Speech and Language Support for All (SALSA) initiative aims to support students presenting with deficits in literacy, numeracy, or behavior through the efforts and expertise of school-based Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP). Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) provides services and resources to students and teachers of students whose primary means of communication is not oral.</p>

<h5>Integrated Arts Education</h5>
<p><a href=""http://www.artseducation.org/integratedartscurr.html"">http://www.artseducation.org/integratedartscurr.html</a><br/>Instruction that is integrated combines teaching in two or more subject areas. The purpose of integrated instruction is to help students gain a deep understanding of an important concept that is common to all the subjects involved. Student work is geared to specific goals and assessments in those subject areas. By combining knowledge and thinking in different disciplines, students learn to apply knowledge learned in one area to challenges in another area—a skill that will serve them well—both in school and in real life. Arts integration means that the arts (dance, music, theatre and visual art) constitute one or more of the integrated subject areas. Arts integration is not a substitute for teaching the arts as separate subjects. Rather it complements traditional arts instruction and helps to affirm the relevance of the arts in the school curriculum.</p>

<h2><strong>Career &amp; Technical Education</strong></h2>
<p>Our students are entering an economy that demands a better educated workforce than ever before. Jobs in this new economy require more complex knowledge and skills than at any point in history. High quality Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs help all students succeed in this new economy, regardless of what path they pursue following high school.</p>
<p>Our mission is to provide access for all students to obtain a high quality career and a technical education program that will prepare for high-skill, high-demand jobs in a changing global economy. We achieve this by providing programs that integrate rigorous academic content into technical subject matter, ensuring that our students will be college and career ready.</p>

<p>ACT WorkKeys</p>
<p>The ACT WorkKeys is a supplemental assessment to the ACT and can be used to obtain additional scholarship money through TOPS Tech for community colleges and some four year colleges. The ACT WorkKeys also provides students with a college and job “resume builder.” The assessments measure foundational skills required for success in the workplace, and help measure the skills that can affect job performance. WorkKeys assessments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>—WorkKeys assessments are developed to solve actual workplace problems. Unlike other assessments, they don’t simply give an indication of reading and writing competency. Instead, they measure a range of hard and soft skills relevant to any occupation, at any level, and across industries.</li>
<li><strong>Recognized</strong>—Successful completion of WorkKeys core assessments can lead to earning an ACT WorkKeys National Career Readiness Certificate—a credential that verifies the skills found to be most essential across industries and occupations. Tens of thousands of employers recognize the value of the NCRC, and many recommend the credential to candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each assessment offers varying levels of difficulty. The levels build on each other, incorporating the skills assessed at the previous levels. For example, at Level 5, individuals need the skills from Levels 3, 4, and 5. The complexity increases as the quantity and/or density of the information increases.</p>
<p>There are three subtests of the ACT WorkKeys assessment: Workplace Documents, Graphic Literacy and Applied Math. Students will have 55 minutes to complete each subtest. Based on their performance on these tests, students will receive a level score of 3-7 for each. Based on your three level scores, you receive a WorkKeys Designation.</p>

<p>“Central to our 2024 strategic plan is preparing all students to graduate ready for a career or college,” said Dr. James Gray, superintendent for JP Schools. “Our students are entering an economy that demands a better educated workforce than ever before. Alongside our local business and industry partners, we’re proud to offer several programs and career pathways to prepare students for high-skilled, high-demand and high-wage jobs.</p>
<p>According to graduation data from 2019, only 51% of JP Schools students immediately entered college following high school graduation. The district is working to close the gap for the other 49% with technical training embedded directly into the high school experience.</p>
<p>Gray emphasized, “It’s critical that we direct equal attention to offering students work-based learning experiences as we do to college preparation. Our local workforce depends on it.”</p>
<p>Career readiness initiatives on JP Schools high school campuses included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiated graduation pathways and diplomas based on a student’s postsecondary plans</li>
<li>Career Technical Education (CTE) in high-demand career clusters</li>
<li>Fast Forward, a pathway to pursue an associate’s degree through a partner community college while simultaneously earning a high school diploma</li>
<li>Leadership opportunities through business clubs, such as Jobs for America’s Graduates</li>
<li>Free registration for the ACT WorkKeys, a career readiness assessment test</li>
<li>Access to the Cuillier Career Center, a state of the art job-training school</li>
<li>Opportunities to earn industry based credentials</li>
<li>Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The awareness campaign focused on high school campuses, but all levels of schools within the district were encouraged to participate by hosting virtual career days, dress-up days and more.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>

<li>


<p>Students new to Jefferson Parish Schools must test for English Proficiency at the English Proficiency Testing Center if a language other than English is spoken in their home. Federal regulations require this process to assure that all students, regardless of language, are provided equal access to education.</p>
<p>If screening indicates the student needs specialized instruction in English, staff will explain the ESL program to the parents. Parents then have the option to select or decline program participation. Regardless of their choice, staff will assist the parent with registration, explain transportation arrangements, and provide basic information on policies governing all JP Schools students.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Office of Multilingual Learning directs the English as a Second Language (ESL) programs in Jefferson Parish Public Schools. Our goal is to help limited English proficiency students, including immigrant students attain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic performance and meet the same challenging state content and achievement standards that all children are expected to meet.</p>
<p>The Office of Multilingual Learning ensures students receive instruction that provides them with comprehensible input. This is accomplished through ESL strategies used by ESL certified teachers, bilingual para-professionals who use the native language to the extent needed by the student to understand the content while they are learning English, and general education teachers who are trained in ESL strategies. In addition, to a reasonable extent, parents are provided information in their native language so that they can fully participate in their child’s education. Please contact The Office of Multilingual Learning, or your child’s school for translation of school documents and interpretation assistance.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<h1>JP Schools Dual Language Program: The gift of bilingualism! </h1>
<p>You may ask yourself why and how can this be done. Our Dual Language program is based on three pillars that have been proven by research to be successful.</p>
<p>Our goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To develop bilingual and bi-literate students</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Today’s workforce has a high demand for competent bilingual and bi-literate professionals. The students will learn to understand, speak, read, and write in both languages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To acquire higher academic achievement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Research demonstrates that students learning two languages do as well or better than their monolingual peers on high stakes tests. The students develop better problem-solving skills and increased cognitive development.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To develop culture competence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We live in a very diverse and multicultural world making learning about other cultures and languages giving them the opportunity to appreciate and respect one another.</p>

<h1>What is Dual Language?</h1>

<p>Dual language is a more effective way of teaching students two languages based on the fundamental premise that children learn a second language the same way they learn their first language. They learn in context where they are exposed to language in its natural form and when they are socially motivated to communicate. The target language is used as the medium of instruction rather than the content of instruction. This means that students acquire content-area knowledge and language skills together.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>How will dual language benefit my child?</h1>

<p>Spanish Dual Language programs in Jefferson Parish Schools are based on the three dual language pillars designed to promote bilingualism and biliteracy, academic student achievement, and social cultural competence.</p>
<p>There is a considerable body of <strong><u>research</u></strong> that outlines the benefits of dual language/immersion programs for students, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>higher academic performance,</li>
<li>greater cognitive development in mental flexibility, creativity, and divergent thinking,</li>
<li>high levels of proficiency in the target language and in English,</li>
<li>positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors, and</li>
<li>enhanced career opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Dual Language Education for a Transformed World</u></em> by Thomas &amp; Cullier, 2012</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>What is a two-way dual language program?</h1>

<p>The two-way model balances the number of ELLs and non-ELLs in a classroom giving both groups the opportunity to learn each other’s language in a natural way. Research tells us that the most effective way to teach English Language Learners is in a two-way dual language program. (Thomas &amp; Cullier, 2010).</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>What language will my child be instructed in?</h1>

<p>Beginning in Pre-K and K the students will receive instruction in Spanish 90% of the day and 10% in English. As they move up to 1<sup>st</sup> grade and beyond, the English will increase 10% each year until a balance of 50%/50% between the Spanish and English language is reached in 4<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Will my child fall behind in learning English?</h1>

<p>Students in a Two-Way immersion (TWI) dual language program may seem to fall behind in the first years as they acquire proficiency in the two languages, but research has demonstrated that by third grade the students are doing as well or better than their monolingual peers.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Will my child be confused learning in two languages?</h1>

<p>Children’s brains are wired to be able to understand multiple languages. Children are very sensitive and flexible to the way different people speak and therefore can learn a second language much easier than adults.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Can I change my mind once my child begins in dual language?</h1>

<p>In order for children to receive the full benefits of participating in a dual language program, parents must make a commitment to allow their children time to acquire the target language over time. Social and academic language acquisition is a process that takes up to five or seven years.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Do I have to know Spanish or English to be able to help my child with homework?</h1>

<p>Knowledge of Spanish or English by the parent is not a prerequisite for a child’s success in the program. Homework is given as a reinforcement of what has been done in class, therefore the child should be able to complete it independently.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Will my child learn the same things that students learn in a monolingual class?</h1>

<p>The LDOE and Jefferson Parish School district expectations and requirements are the same for all JP students. The curriculum used in dual language classrooms align to the LDOE and district requirements and expectations.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>What subjects are taught in Spanish? English?</h1>

<p>Students receive Spanish language arts, math, science, and social studies in Spanish.</p>
<p>In addition, they receive English language development or language arts, and PE in English.</p>
<p>As the students enter higher grades more English subjects are provided creating a balance between the two languages and subjects. When students enter 4<sup>th</sup> grade and up, two subjects will be taught in English and two subjects will be taught in Spanish in addition to receiving language arts in both languages.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>What language will my child learn to read first?</h1>

<p>Students will learn to read in Spanish first and slowly transition into English literacy beginning in 1<sup>st</sup>grade. Spanish literacy is easier to acquire, leading students to transition into English literacy faster.</p>
<p>a. Determine if your attendance school zone offers dual language</p>
<p>b. Attend a parent informational meeting and fill out an intent form</p>
<p>c. Register at your attendance zone school and ask to place your child in dual language</p>
<p>d. If your child is entering PK, follow the same application procedures required for PK registration and choose the option for dual language on the application. This does not guarantee a spot in PK since spots are filled through a lottery.</p>

<h1>Title I</h1>

<p>The purpose of Title I is to ensure that all children have a fair, equal and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments.</p>
<p>Title I is part of the federal Every Student Success Act (ESSA) which was signed into law December 10, 2015, reauthorizing the 50-year-old Elementary and Secondary Education Act and revising many provisions of what was known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB). The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the United States’ national education law and longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all students.</p>
<p>Title I, Part A provides financial assistance to local education agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Title I, Part C: Homeless</h1>

<p>The McKinney-Vento program is designed to address the problems that homeless children and youth face in enrolling, attending, and succeeding in school. Under this program, state educational agencies (SEAs) must ensure that each homeless child and youth has equal access to the same free, appropriate education, including a public pre-school education, as other children and youth. Homeless children and youth should have access to the educational and other services that they need to enable them to meet the same challenging state student academic achievement standards to which all students are held. In addition, homeless students may not be separated from the mainstream school environment. States and districts are required to review and undertake steps to revise laws, regulations, practices, or policies that may act as a barrier to the enrollment, attendance, or success in school of homeless children and youth.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Title I, Part C: Migrant</h1>

<p>This funding supports high quality education programs for migratory children and helps ensure that migratory children who move between states are not penalized in any manner by disparities among states in curriculum, graduation requirements, or state academic content and student academic achievement standards. Funds also ensure that migratory children not only are provided with appropriate education services (including supportive services) that address their special needs but also that such children receive full and appropriate opportunities to meet the same challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards that all children are expected to meet.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Title I, Part D: Neglected and Delinquent</h1>

<p>This funding supports supplementary education services to help provide education continuity for children and youth in state-run institutions for juveniles and in adult correctional institutions so that these youth can make successful transitions to school or employment once they are released.</p>


</li>

<h1>Title II</h1>

<p>The purpose of Title II, Part A is to increase the academic achievement of all students by helping schools and districts improve teacher and principal quality and ensure that all teachers are highly qualified and building excellent systems of support. School districts have the flexibility to use Title IIA funds creatively to address the challenges of teachers and principal quality. Example uses include teacher preparation and qualifications of new teachers, recruitment and hiring, induction, professional development, leadership, and retention.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Title III</h1>

<p>The purpose of Title III is to ensure that limited English proficient students develop English proficiency and meet the same academic content and academic achievement standards that other children are expected to meet. Schools must use these funds to implement language instruction educational programs that use evidence-based activities to increase the knowledge and skills of teachers who serve ELs.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Title IV, Part A</h1>

<p>Title IV, Part A of the ESEA, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) program is intended to help meet the goal of ensuring our educational system prepares every child to graduate from high school ready to thrive in college and careers by increasing the capacity of state educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), schools, and local communities to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide all students with access to a well-rounded education</li>
<li>Improve school conditions by providing students with a safe and healthy learning environment</li>
<li>Improve the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students</li>
</ol>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Title IV, Part B</h1>

<p>The 21st Century Community Learning Centers (CCLC) program is authorized under Title IV, Part B. The 21st CCLC program provides federal funding for the establishment of after-school community learning centers that provide academic, artistic and cultural enrichment opportunities for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools, in order to meet state and local standards in core academic subjects such as reading, math and science. The after-school program includes homework assistance, academic skills coordinated with daily lessons, enrichment activities such as art, dance, drama, sports, and cooking, a snack and a hot dinner before being transported home. This program includes activities for families and the community and provides them an opportunity to be involved in the educational process of their children.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Early Childhood – Pre-K (LA4 TANF &amp; State) &amp; Pre-K Expansion Grant (PEG)</h1>

<p>The Cecil J. Picard LA4 Early Childhood Program is the primary preschool program in the state, serving more than 16,000 children. It provides focused financial support to school systems to provide high-quality early childhood care and education for at-risk four-year-olds. PEG expands the Pre-K program to serve students housed at childcare centers to prepare them to enter Kindergarten ready to learn.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Education Excellence Fund (EEF)</h1>

<p>The Education Excellence Fund (EEF), a special fund constitutionally established within the Millennium Trust, receives a specified share of the state's proceeds from the ""tobacco settlement"". EEF funds provide instructional enhancement for Pre-K through twelfth grade students, including early childhood education programs focused on enhancing the preparation of at-risk children for school, remedial instruction, and assistance to children who score below basic on high stakes tests.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Math and Science Partnership (MSP)</h1>

<p>The purpose of MSP is to improve student achievement and interest in math and science by improving math and science content knowledge and the teaching skills of classroom teachers.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS)</h1>

<p>Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) provides a positive and effective alternative to the traditional methods of discipline. PBIS methods are research-based and proven to significantly reduce the occurrence of problem behaviors in the school, resulting in a more positive school climate and increased academic performance.  The specific goal of PBIS is to replace the use of reactive, punitive, and exclusionary consequences (e.g. detention/suspension/expulsion) with proactive, preventative and educative processes that will reduce the need for disciplinary measures.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>School Climate Transformation Grant (SCTG)</h1>

<p>The goal of the School Climate Transformation grant is to lower the percentage of office discipline referrals and increase attendance rates at all Jefferson Parish schools. By enhancing the existing PBIS framework to meet all levels of supports and interventions, particularly secondary and tertiary, there will be an environment of consistency, safety, and encouragement. Capacity will be built on the district level to provide PBIS technical assistance more effectively at the school level. With the collaboration of community partners and the institution of a School Climate Transformation Team, the issues of school climate, school safety, and mental health needs will be addressed in a comprehensive manner. This team meets quarterly to look at the progression of the School Climate Transformation project and to give input for project strategies and programs. The plan is that all students receive a fair and valuable education through fostering school environments that engage all students in learning and support those who may need additional assistance.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Young Audiences Art Integrated Professional Development Project (AIPD)</h1>

<p>The Young Audiences Arts Integrated Professional Development model builds on a foundation of success by developing and disseminating a rigorous arts integrated professional development program for second through fourth grade teachers in four of Jefferson Parish’s persistently lowest achieving Title 1 schools (Absolute Priority). AIPD will provide educators with tools, strategies, and instructional methods to create original arts integrated lessons aligned with Student Standards and National Core Arts Standards. Leveraged learning that uses the arts as a catalyst will deepen student interest and engagement, nurture understanding through experiential lessons, and make learning memorable. This model will also incorporate a comprehensive, online digital learning platform and tablet technology to increase teacher effectiveness and enhance student learning through the arts.</p>

<h1>What We Do</h1>


<ul>
<li>


<p>The Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education has approved the home study program which allows students to be taught or tutored at home.</p>



</li>
</ul>


















<a href=""/#"">INTERNAL LINK Expand All</a>

<ul>
<li>

<h1>Transfers From Approved Home Study Programs</h1>

<p>A home study student in grades 1-8 can only re-enter a Jefferson Parish public school at the beginning of a nine week grading period. Home study students in grades 9-12 may only re-enter in the fall semester because one-half Carnegie unit credits cannot be awarded with the exception of civics and free enterprise.</p>
<p>A home study student is NOT eligible to participate in either academic, special programs including gifted and/or talented, or extracurricular activities provided by the Jefferson Parish Public Schools for its students. Identified exceptional students as defined by the Louisiana Pupil Appraisal Handbook enrolled in a study program are eligible for the same services as those exceptional students enrolled in private schools. These services are in accordance with service plans developed for private schools within the district.</p>
<p>Home study students are required by the Louisiana Department of Education to be tested once a year for the purpose of determining academic progress. Home study students will be tested only during the week of spring testing in Jefferson Parish. It is the responsibility of the parents to call the school system for testing dates. Students must be tested at the Jefferson Parish school in their attendance district. Parents may contact the schools for testing times. There is a $35 per child testing fee.</p>
<p>In accordance with state guidelines, when a student transfers from home study to an approved public school:</p>
<ul>
<li>The school shall have the authority to test the student to determine the appropriate grade level placement or award Carnegie unit credit.</li>
<li>The student must meet testing requirements of the state accountability program.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Expelled Students Who Have Entered Home Study</h5>
<p>Students who enter home study after being expelled from and returned to a Jefferson Parish School the next year must repeat the grade to which they were assigned before being expelled.</p>


</li>
<li>

<h1>Re-Admission Procedures From Home Study</h1>

<h5>Kindergarten</h5>
<p>A student transferring from home study as a kindergarten student into the Jefferson Parish Public Schools must have reached the age of five by September 30 to be eligible for kindergarten.</p>
<h5>1st Grade</h5>
<p>A student transferring from home study as a first grade student into the Jefferson Parish Public Schools must have reached the age of six by September 30 to be eligible for first grade and must pass the Academic Readiness Screening</p>
<h5>Grades 5-8</h5>
<p>The following transfer/re-admission procedures must be followed for placing a student re-entering grades 5-8 from home study:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parent must provide verification that the student was enrolled in home study with the Louisiana State Department of Education for the previous school year. If the parent does not provide verification, then the student will be placed in the anticipated grade level as evidenced by his prior school records.</li>
<li>If the child was not in state-approved home study and was not attending school, the student will be considered absent from school and will not be eligible for promotion to the next grade.</li>
<li>The principal will request that the parent provide a report card verifying the last grade attended by the student in a public, private, or parochial school.</li>
<li>The principal will refer the parent to the district’s test coordinator for administration of a norm-referenced test. The level of the tests to be administered will be determined by the student’s anticipated grade placement as evidenced by a prior report card or by the home study application.</li>
<li>Students entering grade 5 or grade 9 who are Louisiana residents and are transferring to the public school system from home study shall take the English/language arts and mathematics portions of LEAP 21 and achieve at the Basic/Approaching Basic level or above. A student who registers after administration of the LEAP 21 summer retest, but prior to February 15, must take the ITBS and achieve the standards designated by the Louisiana Department of Education.</li>
<li>If the student performs satisfactorily on the placement test, then the student will be placed in the anticipated grade level as evidenced by prior report cards and the grade designation on the previous home study application.</li>
<li>If the student does not achieve according to the stated criteria on the ITBS, then the student will be placed in a grade level one year below the grade level for which the student would ordinarily have been assigned if the student had successfully completed a program in a private, parochial, or public school the previous school year.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Grades 9-12</h5>
<p>Students entering grade 9 who are Louisiana residents and are transferring to the public school system from home study shall take the English/language arts and mathematics portions of LEAP 21 and achieve at the Basic/Approaching Basic level or above. A student who registers after administration of the LEAP21 summer retest, but prior to February 15, must take the ITED and achieve the standards designated by the Louisiana Department of Education.</p>
<p>The following re-admission procedures will provide a comprehensive assessment plan for determining whether a Carnegie unit will be awarded to a student returning from home study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half-unit Carnegie credits are awarded in home study only for civics and free enterprise.</li>
<li>The principal will request that the parent provide a report card verifying the last grade attended by the student in a public, private, or parochial school.</li>
<li>The parent must provide verification that the student was enrolled in the home study program with the Louisiana State Department of Education from the previous year. If the parent does not provide this minimal verification, then the student will be placed in the anticipated grade level as evidenced by his prior school records.</li>
<li>The parent will provide extensive documentation of a sustained curriculum during the home study program in the identified subject area for which a Carnegie unit is being requested.</li>
<li>If the parent provides extensive documentation of a sustained curriculum during home study in the identified subject area for which a Carnegie unit is being requested, then the student will be administered the appropriate Carnegie unit re-admission exam to determine if Carnegie units can be awarded for each of the subjects taught during home study.</li>
<li>A student admitted to grades 9-12 who meets the criteria established above shall be granted Carnegie units of credit by passing a home study admission examination for each course for which a Carnegie unit is requested. After proficiency examinations are developed by subject area consultants, the State Department of Education will approve the re-admission tests and determine the passing score.</li>
<li>After the student has demonstrated a passing score on the proficiency examination, then the course title earned shall be entered on the Certificate of High School Credits (transcript). Minimum proficiency standards must be indicated in the remarks column.</li>
<li>The student shall not be allowed to take home proficiency examinations in courses previously completed in high school or at level below that which the student has completed.</li>
<li>The student shall not be allowed to take proficiency examinations in art, music, and health and physical education.</li>
<li>If the student is requesting re-admission beyond grade ten, the student will be administered the appropriate sections of the End of Course (EOC) as required by the State Department of Education. These tests can be administered only during the EOC scheduled test administrations in December, May, and summer retest.</li>
</ul>

<li>School systems may charge a fee for the testing of nonpublic and home study students. This testing fee shall be refunded upon the student’s enrollment in that public school system the semester immediately following the testing.</li>
<li>Students who participate in the spring administration and score at the Approaching Basic or Unsatisfactory achievement level are eligible to retake the LEAP 21 at the summer administration.</li>
<li>Local school systems shall offer LEAP 21 summer remediation to nonpublic/home study 4th and 8th grade students who score at the Approaching Basic or Unsatisfactory LEAP 21 achievement level and to those who did not test in the spring, but wish to prepare for the summer administration.
